# BCH MASTER CONCEPT FORMULA

> Built from 75 BCH video analyses across 4 dimensions: Visual Hook, Story Flow, Audience Pull, Maximum Share. Every rule below is evidence-backed from real BCH performance data.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

**When creating a NEW concept:**
1. Start at Phase 1 (Pre-Production) — choose your content type and TG
2. Move to Phase 2 (Hook Engineering) — design the first 3 seconds using the 12-point framework
3. Move to Phase 3 (Story Architecture) — select your beat structure and story shape
4. Move to Phase 4 (Audience Pull) — apply language rules, identity markers, tone
5. Move to Phase 5 (Share Engineering) — calculate the share equation, place triggers
6. Move to Phase 6 (CTA & Conversion) — design the conversion path
7. Run Phase 7 (Kill Tests) — if any test fails, rework before shooting

**When reviewing an EXISTING concept:**
- Jump to Phase 7 (Kill Tests) first for a quick pass/fail
- If it fails, use the relevant phase to identify and fix the weakness

# PHASE 1: PRE-PRODUCTION — CONCEPT DESIGN

## 1.1 Content Type Selection

Pick ONE primary type. This determines your entire strategy.

| Type | Goal | Share Rate Ceiling | Best Story Shape | Duration Target |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Emotional Transformation** | Trust + recall + shares | 0.8%-1.8% | J-Curve or Ascending Staircase | 35-60 sec |
| **Deal/Price Discovery** | Conversion + store visits | 0.2%-1.0% | Front-Loaded Spike or Ramp-Up | 20-35 sec |
| **Comedy/Entertainment** | Reach + brand awareness | 0.1%-0.4% | PAS Comedy Pivot | 25-40 sec |
| **Discovery/Wow Moment** | Shares + follows | 0.8%-1.3% | Dual-Peak | 20-35 sec |
| **Cultural/Identity** | Tribal sharing + loyalty | 0.2%-0.5% | 5-Beat Feature Cascade | 25-40 sec |

## 1.2 Target Audience Identification

**Before writing a SINGLE word, answer these:**

1. **WHO is this for?** (not "parents" — be specific: "Bangalore middle-class mothers aged 28-40 with kids aged 8-13 who've been considering an e-cycle for school commute")
2. **What DAILY LIFE EVENT have they lived through?** (petrol receipt shock, kid outgrowing a cycle, school drop-off struggle)
3. **What OBJECTION do they have right now?** (too expensive, online is cheaper, battery dies, not safe)
4. **What would make them SHARE this?** (save a friend money, show a parent what to buy, prove offline is better)

## 1.3 Protagonist Selection

| Protagonist | Audience Skew | Best For | Share Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Mother** | 55% female | Parent guilt, safety, family decisions | Parent-to-parent sharing |
| **Father + Child** | Balanced | Bonding, aspiration, achievement | "Tag your dad" sharing |
| **Kid alone** | Parents (indirect) | Achievement, emotion, celebration | Universal parent identification |
| **Male commuter** | 73-87% male | Fuel savings, commute, vehicle comparison | Cost-focused utility sharing |
| **Female commuter** | 46% female (unusual) | Safety, lifestyle, broader gender appeal | Care-based sharing |
| **Staff/Salesperson** | Neutral | Feature cascade, bazaar energy, deals | Deal forwarding |
| **Real customer** | Highest trust | Testimonial, transformation, trust-building | Emotional + tribal sharing |

**Rule:** Customer as protagonist → scores cap at 8+. Staff as protagonist → scores cap at 6.3. Always prefer customer/real person.

## 1.4 Hook Type Decision Tree

```
Does the concept have an EMOTIONAL STORY (kid, family, transformation)?
├─ YES → Use NARRATIVE HOOK (lead with emotion, delay product to 0:15+)
│
├─ NO → Does the product have a PRICE/OFFER that shocks?
│  ├─ YES → Use PRICE-SHOCK HOOK (price in first frame, proof within 10 sec)
│  │
│  └─ NO → Is there a CULTURAL ICON that matches the product?
│     ├─ YES → Use CULTURAL-REFERENCE HOOK (icon name + product visual match)
│     │
│     └─ NO → Is there a DAILY PROBLEM the audience experiences?
│        ├─ YES → Use PAS HOOK (dramatize problem to absurdity → reveal solution)
│        │
│        └─ NO → Does the product have a VISUAL WOW feature?
│           ├─ YES → Use DISCOVERY HOOK (wow feature within first 7 seconds)
│           └─ NO → Use CONTROVERSY HOOK (hate comments + defense)
```

---

# PHASE 2: HOOK ENGINEERING — FIRST 3 SECONDS

## 2.1 The 12-Point Hook Scoring Framework

**Score EVERY concept on these 12 dimensions BEFORE shooting. Minimum composite: 7.5/10.**

| # | Dimension | What It Measures | Score 8+ Looks Like | Score Below 6 |
|---|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Involuntary Attention Capture** | Does frame 1 stop scrolling automatically? | Fire, money, danger, faces, anomaly, destruction | Man standing next to bike |
| 2 | **Cognitive Disruption** | Does the visual violate expectations? | Funeral for a cycle, drinking petrol, CCTV of a kid buying | Standard showroom demo |
| 3 | **Curiosity Gap** | Is there an unanswered question? | "Why is he burning a cycle?" "Why did he faint?" | No question — viewer knows what happens next |
| 4 | **Emotional Micro-Trigger** | Does it fire an emotion in <1 second? | Shock, greed, parent guilt, laughter, pride | Purely informational, no feeling |
| 5 | **Platform-Native Twist** | Does it feel like a Reel, not a YouTube ad? | Street Kannada, handheld, UGC energy, trending format | Studio-shot, corporate, landscape video |
| 6 | **Sound-Off Effectiveness** | Does it work fully on mute? | Text overlay carries full hook; visual tells story alone | 100% audio-dependent; mute = meaningless |
| 7 | **Relevance Bridge** | How fast does viewer connect hook to product? | By 0:07 maximum | Product appears only at 0:20+ with no bridge |
| 8 | **Motion/Kinetics** | Is there visual movement in first 3 sec? | 3+ distinct motions, gimbal, cuts, body movement | Static tripod, no zoom, person standing still |
| 9 | **Contrast/Color** | Does the visual pop against a feed? | High-contrast text, bright clothing, product color pop | Dull, low-contrast, blends into feed |
| 10 | **Repetition Resilience** | Does it stay engaging on rewatch? | Emotional depth, new details on repeat | One-time gag, novelty gone after first view |
| 11 | **Thumbnail-Hook Alignment** | Does thumbnail = first frame? | Exact match, zero bait-and-switch | Different thumbnail, viewer clicks and leaves |
| 12 | **Shareability Signal** | Does the hook trigger sharing urge? | "I NEED to send this to someone" within 3 sec | Nothing worth forwarding |

**Composite Score → Expected Performance:**
- **8.5+:** 70%+ watch-past-3s, 1.5%+ share rate, 2M+ views potential
- **7.5-8.4:** 55-70% watch-past-3s, 0.8-1.5% share rate
- **6.5-7.4:** 45-55% watch-past-3s, needs paid distribution
- **Below 6.5:** Don't shoot. Rework.

## 2.2 The 4 Hook Layers

**Design ALL 4 for every concept. All 4 must deliver the SAME message.**

| Layer | What It Is | Rule | Example (V9 — Burning Cycle, scored 9.0) |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Visual** | Physical action that stops the scroll | Must be dramatic, visceral, physical — NOT a phone screen, text chat, or subtle expression | Man LITERALLY sets old cycle on FIRE |
| **Text** | On-screen overlay creating curiosity | Appears by 0:02. 1-3 lines max. High-contrast color. | "King of Cycles / Exchange Offer" |
| **Spoken** | Bold opening line in Kannada | Fires simultaneously with visual, not after. Max 2-3 sentences. | "Old cycle iddre fire hakbidi!" |
| **SFX** | Sound/editing punch that amplifies | Must amplify the visual, not compete with it | Fire crackling + dramatic bass drop |

**Critical Rule:** If visual says "fire," text says "exchange offer," and spoken says "come to our store" — the hook is MISALIGNED and will underperform. All 4 layers must point to the same message.

## 2.3 The 10 Failure Diagnostics

**Run every concept through these 10 checks. Failing 4+ = rework.**

| # | Failure Mode | Test Question | Pass/Fail Threshold |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **No Pattern Interrupt** | Would this first frame make you stop scrolling? | If it looks like "man next to bike" → FAIL |
| 2 | **Confusion** | Can viewer decode premise in 2 seconds? | If they need 5+ seconds to understand → FAIL |
| 3 | **Slow Build** | Does payoff arrive by 0:05? | If hook takes 5+ seconds to fire → FAIL |
| 4 | **Audio Dependency** | Does it work on mute? | If mute = meaningless → FAIL |
| 5 | **Weak Thumbnail** | Does thumbnail match first frame? | If different → FAIL |
| 6 | **Wrong Audience** | Will the FIRST frame attract your TG specifically? | If it attracts random viewers → FAIL |
| 7 | **Clickbait** | Does the video deliver what the hook promises? | If promise ≠ delivery → FAIL |
| 8 | **Over-Promise** | Will the claim trigger "too good to be true" skepticism? | If no proof within 10 sec → FAIL |
| 9 | **No Emotion** | Is there an emotional spike in first 3 sec? | If purely informational → FAIL |
| 10 | **Flat Camera** | Is there movement/cuts in first 3 sec? | If static tripod, no motion → FAIL |

## 2.4 Hook Type Taxonomy

| Hook Type | Avg Score | When To Use | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Absurdist Comedy** | 8.6 | Universal pain point → exaggerate to absurd | V80: Man drinks petrol |
| **Cultural Reference** | 8.4 | Product visually matches beloved icon | V11: Rocky Bhai's e-bike |
| **Family Emotion** | 8.3 | Kid/parent content, achievement, guilt | V21: Child's 5-year savings |
| **PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution)** | 8.0 | Daily problem → dramatize → reveal solution | V80: Petrol pain → e-cycle |
| **Price Shock** | 7.8 | Price so low it triggers disbelief | V32: Rs.999 EMI reveal |
| **Cash/Money Visual** | 7.8 | Physical money in frame activates greed | V35: Money pickup from street |
| **CCTV/Surveillance** | 7.8 | "Caught in the wild" authenticity format | V61: Store CCTV footage |
| **Controversy + Proof** | 7.6 | Open with hate → defend with specs | V27: "People HATE this e-bike" |
| **Before/After Narrative** | 7.4 | Transformation visible in same video | V18: Delivery worker → BCH staff |
| **Testimonial** | 7.1 | Real customer speaks, unscripted | V2: Mother's 5-year savings story |
| **Feature Demo** | 6.9 | Lowest-performing. Use only with strong hook. | V78: Man lists accessories |

---

# PHASE 3: STORY ARCHITECTURE

## 3.1 Story Shape Selection

| Shape | Pattern | Best For | Watch-Through | Risk |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------|------|
| **Ascending Staircase** | Each beat higher than previous, pure climb | Kid achievement, family transformation | Highest (53%+) | No contrast moment |
| **J-Curve** | Dip → Rise → Peak | Mother dragging kid by ear → reward | 50-70% | Needs strong dip |
| **PAS Comedy Pivot** | Problem → Agitation → Solution | Comedy-to-commerce, pain point → product | 81.5% (V80 — highest) | Must commit to comedy first |
| **Dual-Peak** | Peak 1 (hook) → sustain → Peak 2 (reveal) | Cultural reference + feature cascade | 60-67% | Middle must not sag |
| **Ramp-Up + Plateau** | Hook spike → sustained interest → desire plateau | Found money, street skit → product | 70%+ view-past-3s | Lacks dramatic valley |
| **U-Curve / Bookend** | Open peak + close peak, valley in middle | Extended kid buyer journey | 29-32% (LOW) | Middle section kills retention |
| **Front-Loaded Spike** | Peak at 0:00-0:07, gradual decline | Price-only hooks, bait format | 32% (LOW) | All energy spent too early |

**Best performers by watch-through:** PAS Comedy Pivot (81.5%) > Ramp-Up (70%+) > J-Curve (50-70%) > Staircase (53%+)

## 3.2 Beat Structures

| Structure | Total Duration | Beats | Best For |
|-----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **3-Beat** | 15-25 sec | Hook (3-5s) → Proof (5-10s) → CTA (3-5s) | Price hooks, bait-and-switch |
| **4-Beat** | 25-35 sec | Hook (3-5s) → Build (5-10s) → Peak (3-7s) → CTA (3-5s) | Balanced story + resolution |
| **5-Beat** | 30-45 sec | Cultural Hook → Product Intro → Feature Demo → Wow Reveal → CTA | Cultural reference + cascade |
| **6-Beat** | 45-60 sec | Hook → Build → Explore → Climax → Resolve → CTA | Customer transformation |
| **7-Beat** | 60-90 sec | Hook → Arrival → Connection → Showcase → Climax → Celebration → CTA | Full family narrative |

**Rules:**
- Average shot duration: 2.5-4 seconds (not over 5 except for emotional moments)
- 15-20 cuts minimum in feature sections
- Each beat should escalate energy or reveal new information
- Never drop more than 2 energy points between consecutive beats

## 3.3 Twist Timing

| Placement | When | Use For | Risk |
|-----------|------|---------|------|
| **Early (5-15% of video)** | 0:03-0:07 | Bait-and-switch, instant proof | Peaks too early, rest declines |
| **Mid (40-70% of video)** | 0:20-0:40 | Standard optimal for retention | Requires buildup |
| **Late (75-90% of video)** | 0:45-0:55 | Maximum watch-time banking | Most viewers drop before this |

**Optimal:** Twist at 65% mark for 60-90 second content. Setup-to-twist gap: 10-20 seconds.

**Twist velocity rule:** Claim-to-proof within 5 seconds. "This folds like paper" (0:00) → actual fold proof (0:05) = maximum impact.

## 3.4 Unreliable Opening Techniques

Every video scoring 8+ uses one of these:

| Type | Technique | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Genre Misdirection** | Hook looks like one content type, reveals as another | V80: Looks like comedy skit → actually cycle shop |
| **Expectation Reversal** | Opens suggesting one outcome, delivers opposite | V2: Mother drags kid by ear → actually giving a gift |
| **Numerical Misdirection** | Price/number misleads initially | V26: Rs.999 sounds like outright price → is monthly EMI |
| **Skeptic Character** | Opens with doubt/skepticism, character converts | V17: "Is this electrical?" → convinced by features |
| **Visual Contradiction** | What you see contradicts what you hear/expect | V80: Man drinking petrol = absurd visual, real pain point |

## 3.5 Saggy Middle Prevention

**The middle section (0:15-0:35) is where 40-60% of viewers drop. Prevent it with:**

1. **Sub-beat every 3-5 seconds** — one new value/info per sub-beat
2. **Intercut with reaction clips** — showroom (4s) ↔ reaction (2s) pattern
3. **Visual variety within same location** — close-ups rotating: pedals, handlebar, display, battery, frame
4. **Music beat-matching** — features sync to audio hits for rhythmic pacing
5. **Feature escalation** — each feature bigger/better than last (not same energy level)
6. **Thread a narrative through features** — "Rocky Bhai would ride THIS because..." for every feature

**What causes sag:** Same energy start to finish, 25+ second product parade, no escalation, same camera angle for 15+ seconds.

---

# PHASE 4: AUDIENCE PULL ENGINEERING

## 4.1 Language Architecture — The 85/15/2 Rule

| Language Element | Use Case | Rule |
|-----------------|----------|------|
| **Kannada (85% of audio)** | Emotional core, pain points, family address, kinship terms, frustration, joy | NEVER translate financial claims or emotional moments to English |
| **English (15% of audio)** | Technical specs, brand names, action verbs, marketing words | Battery, throttle, EMI, warranty, FREE, JUST, BEST, display |
| **Hindi (2-3%)** | Emphasis/quality words only | "Ekdam" (absolutely), "Pakka" (confirmed), "Dhamaka" (blast) |
| **Text overlays** | ALWAYS English | For cross-linguistic readability, even if audio is Kannada |
| **Numbers/prices** | English convention | Rs.15,000 not ೧೫,೦೦೦ |
| **Sentence structure** | ALWAYS Kannada SOV frame | English words inserted into Kannada sentence order: "Google alli search madidru" |

**Code-Switching Arc Per Video:**
- **Hook (0-3 sec):** Pure Kannada (emotional authenticity)
- **Body (3-25 sec):** Kannada + English mix (information clarity)
- **CTA (25-40 sec):** Mixed — "Visit BCH Jayanagar ge banni" + English text overlay

## 4.2 The Kinship Address System

| Address | Target Age | Formality | When To Use |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **"Bro"** | 18-30 | Ultra-casual | Feature cascade, youth energy, aspirational positioning |
| **"Maga"** | 20-35 | Street-level | Bazaar energy, shock reveals, street skits. Can repeat 3+ times per sentence. |
| **"Anna"** | 25-40 | Respectful-casual | Adult demos, fold reveals, premium positioning |
| **"Guru"** | 25-45 | Insider/expert | Value stacking, budget positioning, feature highlighting |
| **"Sir"** | 35+ | Formal-respectful | Store transactions, older customer interactions |
| **"Putta"** | Children | Endearment | Staff to child interactions, warmth moments |
| **"Raja"** | Any | Hyper-local | Ultra-casual Bangalore street context |

**Rule:** Don't mix addresses within one video. "Anna" throughout OR "Bro" throughout — consistency = tone consistency.

## 4.3 Identity Markers That Drive Engagement

**Use at least 2 per concept:**

| Marker | What It Signals | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **"Namma" (our)** | Tribal belonging — THE most powerful Kannada identity word | "Namma BCH," "Namma Super Kid" |
| **Biryani** | Universal Bangalore pleasure/comfort anchor | "Baa guru biriyani tinnona" |
| **KGF / Rocky Bhai** | Sandalwood cinema fandom (massive in Karnataka) | "Rocky Bhai style gaadi bro" |
| **Petrol receipt** | Pan-Indian commuter pain (fuel cost) | Physical receipt as prop |
| **Festival name** | Temporal relevance + cultural calendar | "Makara Sankranti offer" |
| **Auto-rickshaw in frame** | Iconic Bangalore commute symbol | Background element |
| **Auspicious leaves on product** | Traditional blessing/puja before purchase | Product decoration |
| **School commute reference** | Parent's daily life event | "School ge hogboudu" |

## 4.4 Pull Phrase Patterns

**High-performing phrase structures (use these templates):**

| Pattern | Template | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Price Shock** | "Kevala Rs.[X] ge!" (Only Rs.X!) | "Kevala Rs.999 ge!" | "Kevala" minimizes price; creates disbelief |
| **Impossible Claim** | "[Extreme claim] + Sir/Bro" | "7 rupayige 100 kilometer, sir!" | Precision creates believability + shareability |
| **Category Elevation** | "Idu [old category] alla, idu [new brand]!" | "Idu cycle alla, idu E-Motorad!" | Negation forces cognitive reprocessing |
| **Peer Recommendation** | "Nan tara [action] thogobidu" | "Nan tara electrical cycle thogobidu" | Peer recommendation = most trusted influence |
| **Urgency Repeat** | "Bega bega [action] madi" | "Bega bega visit madi" | Doubled urgency word for emphasis |
| **Demographic Sweep** | "For [X]? Yes. For [Y]? Yes." | "For girls? Yes. For boys? Yes. For shoki? Yes." | Covers every segment = "this is for ME" |
| **Conditional Gate** | "Follow madilla andre [consequence]" | "Follow madilla andre offer kodalla" | Gates value behind action (playful, not threatening) |

## 4.5 Tone Architecture (5-Act Energy Curve)

| Act | Timestamp | Energy | Tone |
|-----|-----------|--------|------|
| 1. Hook | 0:00-0:07 | 8-10/10 | Shock/emotion/pain point |
| 2. Trust | 0:08-0:15 | 6-7/10 | Authority/expertise/social proof |
| 3. Features | 0:16-0:25 | 7-8/10 | Enthusiastic/demonstrative/rapid-fire |
| 4. Secret/Bonus | 0:26-0:33 | 5-6/10 | Conspiratorial/playful/insider |
| 5. Close | 0:34-0:41 | 5-7/10 | Casual/celebratory/peer-to-peer |

## 4.6 Before → After Shift (Design This For Every Concept)

| BEFORE (viewer state at 0:00) | AFTER (viewer state at end) |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| "E-cycles cost 30-50K — out of budget" | "Rs.999/month — less than my Swiggy bill" |
| "E-bikes are toys, not real vehicles" | "This has fatter tires than a Bullet and goes 100km for Rs.7" |
| "Is this some Instagram scam?" | "Official poster + bank logos + real customers = legit" |
| "Cycle shops are just shops" | "BCH transforms kids' birthdays" |
| "I'm a motorcycle guy" | "Maybe being smart about commuting is cooler" |

---

# PHASE 5: SHARE ENGINEERING

## 5.1 The Share Decision Equation

```
I (Identity) × E (Emotion) × S (Safety) = Share Score

THRESHOLDS:
- 650+  → Hyper-viral (exceptional)
- 500+  → Viral confirmed
- 400-499 → Near-viral (needs timing/context boost)
- Below 400 → Won't go viral through shares
```

**Score each variable 1-10:**

| Variable | 9-10 | 7-8 | 5-6 | 3-4 |
|----------|------|-----|-----|-----|
| **I (Identity)** | "This is WHO I am" (fandom, parent, commuter) | "I care about this" (values, aspirations) | "This is relatable to me" | "Interesting but not me" |
| **E (Emotion)** | Peak emotion: tears, laughter, shock, inspiration | Strong: excitement, warmth, recognition | Moderate: curiosity, mild satisfaction | Weak: amusement without feeling |
| **S (Safety)** | Zero risk to share. Family-friendly. Universal. | Safe with minor caveats | Moderate risk. Some controversy. | High risk. Will face judgment. |

**For deal content, use the UTILITY variant:**
```
PV (Practical Value) × S (Safety) × R (Reach Relevance) = Utility Share Score
- PV 10/10 = Exact price + product + location + phone number
- Can exceed 500 even if emotion is low
```

## 5.2 Share Motivation Types

| Type | % of BCH Shares | Avg Rate | Trigger | Content Match |
|------|-----------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Discovery** | 35% | 1.18% | "Wow, you HAVE to see this" | Feature reveals, price shock, visual wow |
| **Deal Forwarding** | 28% | 1.02% | "My friend NEEDS this deal" | Price + proof + phone number |
| **Comedy** | 18% | 0.95% | "This is hilarious, watch this" | Absurd visual + deadpan |
| **Feel-Good** | 12% | 1.30% (highest!) | "This is beautiful, I want others to feel this" | Transformation, family, achievement |
| **Cultural Pride** | 7% | 0.87% | "Our community should see this" | Kannada content, local pride |

## 5.3 Share Trigger Placement

| Timing | Window | Best For | % of Viewers Who See It |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| **Front-loaded** | 0:00-0:10 | Price shock, absurd comedy, visual wow | 85-90% |
| **Mid-reveal** | 0:15-0:30 | Feature proof, store reveal, customer reaction | 50-70% |
| **Back-loaded** | 0:35-0:55 | Emotional resolution, transformation reveal | 25-40% |

**Rule:** Primary share trigger MUST land before the 25-second mark (covers 70%+ of viewers). If video is 45+ sec, add a SECOND trigger at 35-40 sec.

## 5.4 Share Killers — AVOID THESE

| Killer | Risk | Why | Fix |
|--------|------|-----|-----|
| **Aggressive CTA ("BUY NOW")** | FATAL | Turns sharer into unpaid promoter | Passive CTA (phone number overlay only) |
| **Purchase price on screen** (for emotion/discovery content) | HIGH | Creates "can I afford this?" filter | Show running cost instead (Rs.7/100km) |
| **Controversial claims** | HIGH | "Bullet is waste" → motorcycle fans attack sharer | Positive framing ("better for you"), not competitive |
| **Gross-out without purpose** | HIGH | Low-status share; viewer won't associate | Pair shock with aspirational payoff |
| **Video > 60 seconds** | HIGH | 60% of viewers never reach late-placed triggers | Keep under 40 sec; or use multiple triggers |
| **Feels like an ad** | MEDIUM | Branded staff, heavy product placement, studio production | Disguise as customer story or entertainment |
| **No identity signal** | MEDIUM | "Sharing this says NOTHING about me" | Add cultural reference, fandom angle, or values statement |
| **One-time novelty gag** | MEDIUM | Shared once, never recommended again | Add repeat-share value (evergreen emotion, ongoing deal) |
| **No specific recipient** | MEDIUM | "Who do I send this to?" | Include clear recipient angle (father-son, friend, commuter) |

---

# PHASE 6: CTA & CONVERSION

## 6.1 Persistent CTA Banner Rule

**On EVERY video:** Display `📍 BCH Jayanagar | 📞 [channel phone number]` at the top of screen for the ENTIRE duration.

| Channel | Phone Number |
|---------|-------------|
| BCH Main | 9380097119 |
| Wattson Wheelz | 7996994427 |
| BCH Toyz | 9019107283 |

**Why:** The viral Sri Sai Mobiles video proved persistent CTA banner → massively increased recall. BCH's own data confirms: phone number persistent for 50%+ of video → higher conversion.

## 6.2 CTA Friction Hierarchy

| CTA Type | Friction | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| "Visit us" + location | Lowest (deferred) | All content — lets viewer act later |
| "DM [keyword]" | Medium (async) | Series-specific conversion tracking |
| "WhatsApp [number]" | Medium (async) | Adult audience, longer consideration |
| "Call [number]" | Highest (immediate) | Urgent offers, time-limited deals |

## 6.3 CTA Formula (Use On Every Video)

**2-Layer CTA (max 5 seconds):**

1. **Video-specific CTA** (~3 sec): Action + channel phone number
2. **Brand signature CTA** (~2 sec): "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni" — MANDATORY on EVERY video

**CTA Components:** Signature phrase + Behavioral trigger + Location (BCH Jayanagar) + Deadline + DM keyword

## 6.4 Objection Handling On Camera

**Address the #1 objection for each TG directly in the video:**

| TG | #1 Objection | How to Handle |
|----|-------------|---------------|
| Online comparison-shoppers | "Amazon is cheaper" | Show Amazon listing, red-marker the price, show BCH price lower |
| Parents worried about safety | "Is it safe for my child?" | List safety features: speed lock, weight, brakes, GPS |
| Petrol commuters | "Battery dies mid-ride?" | "60 km range — office and back with 30 km left" |
| Budget buyers | "Can't afford it" | "Rs.999/month EMI — less than your chai budget" |
| Skeptics | "Is this real/scam?" | Show receipt, store exterior, real customers, bank logos |

**Rule:** The objection must be SPOKEN by a character (customer voice) and ANSWERED by staff on camera. Not just implied — addressed directly.

## 6.5 POV Store Directions

**Film ONCE, reuse on ALL reels as a 5-second ending clip:**
- Camera on handlebars, riding from a nearby landmark to BCH store entrance
- Google Maps-style arrow overlay
- Text: "3 minutes from Jayanagar Metro" (or nearest landmark)
- Sped up 2x for energy

---

# PHASE 7: KILL TESTS — FINAL GATE

**Every concept must pass ALL 6 tests before shooting. Fail any = rework.**

## Test 1: Share Test
> "Would someone screenshot this and send it to a SPECIFIC person?"

If no clear recipient relationship exists (parent-to-parent, friend-to-commuter, spouse-to-spouse), the concept lacks share motivation.

## Test 2: Comment Test
> "Is there a built-in reason for viewers to comment?"

Best triggers: "Drop your [X] below," "Tag someone who [Y]," polarizing question, debate angle.

## Test 3: Memory Test
> "Describe this concept to someone a week later. Do they remember it?"

The concept must have ONE vivid image that sticks: "That reel where the guy burned his cycle," "That reel where the kid fainted at the price."

## Test 4: Chai Test
> "Could you describe this to a friend over chai in one sentence?"

If it takes more than one sentence, the concept is too complex. The single sentence IS the concept. If it doesn't make them react, it's not a concept.

## Test 5: TG Filter Test
> "If this goes viral, will the viewers actually be potential BUYERS?"

Show the concept to 3 people NOT in your TG. If they love it too, the hook is too generic (Tata Ace problem).

## Test 6: Tata Ace Test
> "Strong hook + wrong audience = wasted content."

The hook must attract the RIGHT person (parent, commuter, cyclist), not just ANY person. A burning cycle attracts destruction-lovers AND exchange-seekers. A kid fainting at price attracts only price-conscious parents. The second is better targeted.

# PHASE 8: DIRECTION NOTES TEMPLATE

**Include these with EVERY concept:**

## 8.1 Videographer Rules (From High-Performers)
- Camera angles: Low ground-level, over-shoulder, progressive zoom-in, POV from vehicle
- Natural light preferred over studio (outdoor/golden hour)
- Handheld for first 3 seconds (authenticity), gimbal for body if needed
- Collect 2-3 camera angles per scene for editorial flexibility
- Every movement serves the narrative — no movement for movement's sake
- Close-ups: Rotate subjects every 2-3 seconds (pedals, handlebar, display, battery, seat)

## 8.2 Editor Rules (From High-Performers)
- Cut timing: 2.5-3.5 second average shot in hook
- Text animation: Different effect per tier (fire = price, glow = features, 3D = product name)
- Beat matching: Audio + cut + text all land simultaneously
- Sound-off strategy: From 0:00-0:03, assume 50-70% are on mute. Hook must work visually.
- Energy curve engineering: Start HIGH, dip LOW mid-section, spike HIGH at CTA
- No English subtitles needed for Karnataka audience — Kannada audio + English text overlay sufficient

## 8.3 Talent Direction Rules
- **3x exaggeration rule:** What looks "too much" on set looks "just right" on phone
- **Staff tone:** Casual, bored-confident, like this happens 10 times a day (contrast between calm staff and shocked customer = comedy)
- **Customer tone:** Genuine reactions only. Never say "act surprised" — create actual surprise.
- **Kids:** ZERO scripting. Let them speak naturally. Scripted kid = instant audience detection = video fails.
- **Facial expressions:** Wide eyes, jaw drop, physical flinch — visible on a 6-inch screen
- **Body contact with product:** SLAP, BANG, THROW items. Physical contact = subconscious ownership transfer for viewer.
- **No background music for conversion reels.** Kannada vocal energy carries retention. Reserve music for entertainment/celebration content.
