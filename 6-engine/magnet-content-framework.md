# Magnet Content Framework — Next.BLR

> Built from: NB-M1 "10 Gifts Only For Followers" success + research
> Purpose: Repeatable framework for creating content that PULLS — followers, store visits, and buying decisions
> Status: Proven at Level 1 (Follower Gate). Levels 2-3 (Decision + Conversion) ready to test.

---

## What Is Magnet Content?

Regular content: viewer watches → viewer leaves. Value is consumed.
Magnet content: viewer watches → viewer takes ACTION to qualify for ongoing value. Value is conditional.

```
Regular:  ATTENTION → ENGAGEMENT → (maybe follow)
Magnet:   ATTENTION → DESIRE → GATE (action required) → REWARD
```

The gate can be anything: follow, visit store, DM, test ride booking, share. The key is the viewer must DO something to unlock the value.

---

## The 3 Levels of Magnet Content

| Level | Gate Action | Goal | Proven? |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| **Level 1: Follow Magnet** | Follow the page | Follower growth | YES — NB-M1 drove 734→10K |
| **Level 2: Decision Magnet** | Save / DM / visit profile | Move closer to buying decision | TO TEST |
| **Level 3: Conversion Magnet** | Visit store / book test ride / DM keyword | Actual store footfall + sales | TO TEST |

**Key insight:** Level 1 gets followers. But followers are NOT buyers. Levels 2-3 move followers through the funnel toward purchase.

---

## Level 1: Follow Magnet (PROVEN)

### The Formula
```
FOLLOW MAGNET = (Visual Anomaly × Explicit Gate) + (Escalation Stack × Proof Density) + Status Signal
```

### Validated Mechanics (from NB-M1)
- **Explicit Gate:** "ONLY FOR FOLLOWERS" text at 0:00
- **Escalation Stack:** Items added sequentially (not shown all at once)
- **Proxy Protagonist:** Kid/unexpected person receiving value
- **Physical Proof:** Items touched, worn, demonstrated on camera
- **Prediction Error:** Each item more premium than expected

### 5 Non-Negotiable Rules
1. Gate must be explicit AND visible in text overlay within 0-2 seconds
2. Proof must be physical and immediate (shown being delivered in the video)
3. Stack > Single item (volume perception beats value perception)
4. Protagonist must be "undeserving" (kid, random person — NOT influencer/staff)
5. Follow framed as "joining" not "subscribing"

### Cadence
1 follow magnet per 3-4 regular posts. More = cheapens brand.

---

## Level 2: Decision Magnet (NEXT TO BUILD)

### What Decision Magnets Do
Instead of gating behind a follow, you gate behind actions that move the viewer closer to buying:
- **Save** (viewer bookmarks for later = high purchase intent signal)
- **DM a keyword** (opens a conversation = warm lead)
- **Visit profile/link** (enters the sales funnel)

### The Psychology
At 10K followers, your content reaches people who already follow. These people know the brand exists. The bottleneck is no longer awareness — it's **decision**.

The buying decision for a Rs. 35,000-60,000 e-cycle has 5 barriers:
1. "Is it worth the money?" (value uncertainty)
2. "Will it work for MY commute?" (fit uncertainty)
3. "What if the battery dies / breaks?" (risk uncertainty)
4. "What will people think?" (social uncertainty)
5. "Where do I even start?" (action uncertainty)

**Decision magnets attack these barriers one at a time, inside entertaining content.**

### 5 Decision Magnet Formats

**DM-1: The Commuter Math Magnet (attacks barrier #1: value)**
- Content: Dramatically calculate the real cost comparison. Physical cash stacks. Receipts.
- "Petrol per month: Rs. 4,000. Auto/Uber: Rs. 6,000. E-cycle per month: Rs. 350 in electricity."
- Gate: "Save this. Next time your petrol bill hits, you'll need these numbers."
- CTA variant: "DM 'MATH' — we'll calculate YOUR specific commute savings."
- Why it works: Saves = algorithm boost + viewer revisits when they see their next petrol bill

**DM-2: The "Your Commute" Magnet (attacks barrier #2: fit)**
- Content: Map a real Bangalore commute on the e-cycle. Film it. Time it.
- "Koramangala to Whitefield. Car: 1h 40m. E-cycle: 55 minutes. Zero parking."
- Gate: "DM your route — we'll tell you if an e-cycle works for it."
- Why it works: Personalizes the product. DM = warm lead. Every DM = sales conversation starter.

**DM-3: The Objection Destroyer (attacks barrier #3: risk)**
- Content: Take the most common objection and destroy it on camera with proof.
- "Battery dies in 6 months? Here's a cycle we sold 18 months ago. [show battery meter: still at 85%]"
- Gate: "Comment your biggest doubt. We'll film answers to the top 5."
- Why it works: Comments = engagement boost + you learn real objections + content ideas forever

**DM-4: The Identity Flex (attacks barrier #4: social)**
- Content: Show real Bangalore riders (techies, startup founders, women commuters) riding e-cycles.
- "3 software engineers at [tech company] cycle to work. Here's why."
- Gate: "Tag someone who needs to see this" / "Share with your Bangalore group"
- Why it works: Normalizes e-cycling among TG. Shares = social proof. Tagging = warm referral.

**DM-5: The "One Step" Magnet (attacks barrier #5: action)**
- Content: Remove ALL friction from the next step. Make it dead simple.
- "Don't know which cycle fits you? DM 'QUIZ' — we'll ask you 3 questions and recommend one."
- Gate: "DM 'QUIZ'" or "DM 'TEST RIDE'"
- Why it works: The person doesn't need to research. One DM = they're in the funnel.

---

## Level 3: Conversion Magnet — THE COMPLETE FRAMEWORK

> The most important section. This is where content becomes revenue.
> Built from: BCH data (88% store conversion, 85% first-visit purchase, 7-day window) + 7 purchase triggers from playbook + research

---

### The Core Truth About Conversion

From BCH's own data:
- **88% of people who walk into the store BUY.** The store sells itself.
- **85% buy on their FIRST visit.** 30-minute average decision.
- **65% forget BCH/Next.BLR if they don't visit within 7 days** of discovering it.
- **88% say "we saw you online"** when they walk in.
- **1 customer video = 4 more customers.** Proven multiplier.

**This means ONE THING: the content's job is to get them to the store. The store does the rest.**

Every conversion magnet must be optimized for ONE outcome: **physical store visit within 7 days.**

---

### Why Conversion Magnets Are Different From Regular CTAs

| Regular CTA | Conversion Magnet |
|---|---|
| "Visit BCH Jayanagar" (instruction) | Content that makes NOT visiting feel like a loss (motivation) |
| Tells them what to do | Makes them WANT to do it |
| Rational: here's the address | Emotional: here's what you're missing |
| One-time ask at the end | The entire video builds toward the visit |
| Viewer thinks "maybe someday" | Viewer thinks "this weekend" |

**A conversion magnet doesn't ask the viewer to visit. It makes the viewer feel STUPID for not visiting.**

---

### The 7-Day Conversion Window System

Every conversion magnet must work within the 7-day window. Structure:

```
DAY 0: Viewer sees the conversion magnet Reel
DAY 0-1: FOMO/desire peaks → viewer saves the Reel or DMs keyword
DAY 1-3: Viewer discusses with spouse/friend (the "co-decision" phase)
DAY 3-7: Visit window — content has already given them:
  ✓ Which model to ask about
  ✓ What price to expect
  ✓ What the store experience is like
  ✓ A specific reason to go THIS week (not "someday")
DAY 7+: If no visit → lost. Need retargeting content.
```

**Every conversion magnet must include a TIME ANCHOR — a reason to visit THIS week, not "whenever."**

---

### The 8 Conversion Magnet Types

#### CM-1: THE FIRST REACTION MAGNET
**Purpose:** Trigger the viewer's self-projection. "If THEY reacted like that, what would I feel?"
**Based on:** Purchase Trigger #1 (Self-Projection / Mirror Effect) + BCH data: test ride = 5-minute decision trigger

**How it works:**
Film a REAL person's first time on the e-cycle. Not staged. Not an influencer. A regular Bangalore commuter — someone who looks like the viewer's friend, colleague, or self.

**The 4-Beat Structure:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): SKEPTIC HOOK — "I don't think an e-cycle can replace my Activa."
  Visual: Person standing, arms crossed, looking doubtful at the cycle
  Text: "Bangalore techie tries an e-cycle for the first time"

Beat 2 (3-12s): THE RIDE — First pedal. First throttle. The acceleration surprise.
  Visual: Face close-up. The EXACT moment doubt becomes excitement.
  The face is the content. Not the cycle. The FACE.

Beat 3 (12-20s): THE REALIZATION — "Wait... this actually works for my commute?"
  They start calculating out loud: "Koramangala to Whitefield... this would take..."
  Visual: Riding through recognizable Bangalore locations

Beat 4 (20-30s): THE CONVERT — Person literally doesn't want to get off the cycle.
  Gate: "We let 5 people test ride every Saturday. DM 'RIDE' to book your slot."
  Text overlay: "BCH Jayanagar | This Saturday | 5 slots only"
```

**Why it converts:** The viewer doesn't see a product demo. They see THEMSELVES. Mirror neurons fire. They experience the ride vicariously. The DM is the lowest-friction next step.

**Non-negotiable rules:**
- Person must be demographically identical to TG (22-35, techie look, Bangalore vibe)
- Reaction must be GENUINE. If faked, the "moral trigger collapses" (your words from NB-M1)
- Must show a specific Bangalore location during the ride (ORR, Koramangala, HSR)
- The cycle model and price must appear on screen (removes the "can I afford this?" barrier)

---

#### CM-2: THE COMMUTER MATH DESTROYER
**Purpose:** Make the current spending feel PAINFUL and the e-cycle feel like a math problem with an obvious answer.
**Based on:** Purchase Trigger #6 (Price Anchoring + Value Reframing) + BCH data: Rs. 999/month = magic EMI number

**How it works:**
Take a real Bangalore commuter's monthly expenses and create a PHYSICAL, VISUAL cost comparison.

**The Stack Structure:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): PHYSICAL CASH HOOK
  Visual: Slam Rs. 4,000 in cash on a table. "This is what you spend on petrol every month."
  Text: "YOUR MONTHLY COMMUTE COST"

Beat 2 (3-8s): THE STACK
  Add Rs. 2,000 more: "Parking fees at office."
  Add Rs. 3,000 more: "Auto/Uber on rain days."
  Add Rs. 1,500 more: "Servicing your bike every 3 months."
  Total cash pile growing physically on the table.

Beat 3 (8-15s): THE ANNUAL GUT PUNCH
  "That's Rs. 10,500 a month. Rs. 1,26,000 a year."
  Visual: The cash pile is now enormous. Spread it out. Let it fill the frame.
  "In 3 years? Rs. 3,78,000. Gone. Into petrol and parking."

Beat 4 (15-22s): THE REFRAME
  Place the e-cycle next to the cash pile.
  "This cycle: Rs. 59,999. Runs on Rs. 350/month of electricity."
  "It pays for itself in 6 months. After that, you're MAKING money every month."
  Text: "Rs. 999/month EMI — less than your daily Uber"

Beat 5 (22-30s): THE GATE
  "Save this Reel. Next time you fill petrol, look at the receipt, then watch this again."
  "Or DM 'MATH' — we'll calculate YOUR exact commute savings."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | Open Sunday"
```

**Why it converts:** The viewer isn't comparing "e-cycle price vs. my budget." They're comparing "e-cycle price vs. money I'm ALREADY LOSING." The cash pile makes the loss tangible. The EMI reframe makes the action easy.

**Variants:**
- Uber/Ola vs. e-cycle (for cab commuters)
- Auto fare vs. e-cycle (for auto users)
- Metro + last-mile auto vs. Metro + Flex GO (for metro commuters)

---

#### CM-3: THE OBJECTION AUTOPSY
**Purpose:** Take the #1 objection and kill it on camera with physical proof — not words, PROOF.
**Based on:** Purchase Trigger #3 (Specific Social Proof) + Trigger #4 (Loss Framing)

**The 5 Objections to Kill (one video per objection):**

| # | Objection | Proof That Kills It |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Battery will die in 6 months" | Show battery meter on an 18-month-old cycle: still 85%. Film the actual screen. |
| 2 | "25 km/h is too slow" | Film in Bangalore traffic. Speedometer of the car next to you: 12 km/h. You: 25 km/h. Race them. Win. |
| 3 | "Bangalore roads will destroy it" | Ride through the worst pothole you can find. Slow-mo the dual suspension absorbing it. Then ride over the same pothole in an Activa. Compare. |
| 4 | "It's not safe — no protection" | Show the hydraulic disc brakes stopping instantly. Show the lights. Show the helmet + gear stack. Compare braking distance to a regular cycle. |
| 5 | "Rs. 60K is too expensive" | The Commuter Math Destroyer (CM-2) handles this. But also: show 3 things that cost Rs. 60K that people buy without thinking — 2 years of gym membership nobody uses, a phone upgrade, a weekend Goa trip. |

**Structure for each:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): STATE THE OBJECTION — read it from a "real DM" or "real comment"
  Visual: Phone screen showing the actual comment/DM (or recreate it)
  Spoken: "Someone asked: 'Won't the battery die in 6 months?'"
  Text: The objection text, large

Beat 2 (3-15s): THE PROOF — don't argue. SHOW.
  Don't say "no it won't." SHOW the battery meter. SHOW the cycle that's been used for 18 months.
  The proof is physical, on camera, undeniable.

Beat 3 (15-22s): THE FLIP — turn the objection into a selling point
  "Not only does the battery last... it has a 2-year warranty. And it costs Rs. 7 per 100 km to charge."
  Now the objection became a FEATURE.

Beat 4 (22-30s): THE GATE
  "Got another doubt? Comment it. We'll film the answer."
  "Or DM 'DOUBT' — we'll answer anything before your visit."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | Test ride it yourself"
```

**Why it converts:** Objections are the #1 reason people don't buy. Most brands ignore objections or answer with text. Filming the PROOF on camera creates irrefutable evidence. The "comment your doubt" gate generates unlimited content ideas AND qualifies leads (someone commenting their doubt is in the consideration phase).

---

#### CM-4: THE TRANSFORMATION WITNESS
**Purpose:** Show the before → after of someone who actually made the switch. Not the product transformation — the LIFE transformation.
**Based on:** Purchase Trigger #5 (Bridge Moment) + BCH data: 1 video = 4 customers

**How it works:**
Find a REAL customer who switched from car/bike/auto to e-cycle. Film their actual daily life. Before AND after.

**Structure:**
```
BEFORE (0-10s):
  "6 months ago, Rahul spent 2 hours in traffic every day. Rs. 4,000 on petrol. Arrived at work stressed."
  Visual: Bangalore traffic. ORR. Silk Board. The commute pain everyone knows.
  Keep it SHORT — the "before" is the HOOK. Everyone watching has lived this.

THE SWITCH (10-15s):
  "Then he tried something. One test ride at BCH Jayanagar."
  Visual: Him on the e-cycle. First time. The face. The surprise.

AFTER (15-25s):
  "Now: 35-minute commute. Rs. 350/month. Arrives smiling."
  Visual: Him riding through the same Bangalore streets — but NOW he's moving. Others are stuck.
  Show the LIFESTYLE: him arriving at work. Parking the cycle. Co-workers noticing.
  "He lost 4 kg in 2 months without trying."

THE GATE (25-30s):
  "Rahul was you 6 months ago. The difference? One test ride."
  "DM 'SWITCH' — tell us your commute. We'll tell you how to fix it."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | Every Saturday | Test rides"
```

**Why it converts:** This is the most powerful conversion format. The viewer sees a PERSON LIKE THEM who had the SAME PROBLEM and solved it. The brain can't help but project: "If he did it, I can too." The Bridge Moment (tension → resolution) creates cortisol + oxytocin = action.

**Non-negotiable:** Must be a REAL customer. Not scripted. Not an actor. Real name, real commute, real numbers. If it looks fake, it fails completely.

---

#### CM-5: THE STORE EXPERIENCE MAGNET
**Purpose:** Remove the "unknown" barrier. Viewers who've never been to a cycle store don't know what to expect. Show them.
**Based on:** BCH data: 88% store conversion rate means the store experience is the closer. Let content preview it.

**Structure:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): "What happens when you walk into BCH Jayanagar?"
  Visual: POV walking through the store entrance
  Text: "YOUR FIRST VISIT TO BCH"

Beat 2 (3-10s): THE WELCOME — show the vibe, not the products
  Staff greeting casually (not salesy). The showroom. Natural light.
  "No one sells you anything here. They ask 3 questions: Where do you commute? How far? What's your budget?"

Beat 3 (10-18s): THE TEST RIDE — the moment that closes
  "Then they hand you a cycle and say: 'Take it outside. Ride it.'"
  Film the actual test ride moment. The parking lot. The first pedal.
  "This is where 85% of people decide."

Beat 4 (18-25s): THE CHOICE — show the range
  Quick cuts: Sherpa Z1 (Rs. 34,999) → Sherpa M1 (Rs. 44,999) → Flex GO (Rs. 59,999) → Street Mamba (Rs. 59,999)
  "5 models. Rs. 34,999 to Rs. 59,999. Rs. 999/month EMI."

Beat 5 (25-30s): THE GATE
  "This Saturday: walk in, test ride, no obligation."
  "DM 'VISIT' for directions + available models."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | 10 AM - 8 PM | All days"
```

**Why it converts:** Fear of the unknown kills action. Most people have never been to a cycle store as adults. Showing them EXACTLY what happens — and that it's low-pressure — removes the friction. The "85% decide on the first visit" stat is social proof that the experience itself does the selling.

---

#### CM-6: THE CO-DECISION MAGNET
**Purpose:** Help the viewer convince the OTHER person in the buying decision (spouse, friend, parent).
**Based on:** Research: group decisions require content formatted as "evidence I can forward"

**How it works:**
For Next.BLR's TG (22-35 urban commuters), the co-decider is usually:
- **Spouse/partner:** "Should we spend Rs. 60K on a cycle?"
- **Roommate/friend:** "Is this legit or a fad?"
- **Parent (for younger end):** "Is this safe?"

**Structure — "The Forward" Format:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): "Your [partner/friend] thinks cycling in Bangalore is crazy."
  Visual: Someone showing their phone to a skeptical partner
  Text: "Send this to the person stopping you from buying an e-cycle"

Beat 2 (3-12s): Stack the RATIONAL arguments (for the co-decider, not the buyer)
  The buyer already WANTS the cycle. The co-decider needs LOGIC.
  "Save Rs. 1,26,000/year on commute."
  "5-year frame warranty."
  "25 km/h max speed — legally can't go dangerous."
  "80-105 km range — covers any Bangalore commute twice over."

Beat 3 (12-20s): The IDENTITY shift
  "Companies like [X] are giving employees cycling allowances."
  "Bangalore is building 250 km of cycling infrastructure."
  "This isn't a trend. This is the future commute."

Beat 4 (20-30s): THE GATE
  "Forward this to whoever needs convincing."
  "Both of you, come for a test ride this Saturday. They'll change their mind in 5 minutes."
  "DM 'CONVINCE' for a one-page PDF with all the numbers your partner needs."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | Test ride for couples/friends"
```

**Why it converts:** The buyer who wants the cycle but needs "permission" is the highest-intent prospect you have. They've already decided. They need ammunition for the conversation at home. This Reel IS that ammunition. The "forward this" mechanic makes the viewer an active salesperson.

---

#### CM-7: THE SCARCITY PROOF MAGNET
**Purpose:** Create urgency through REAL proof that others are buying — not fake countdown timers.
**Based on:** Purchase Trigger #7 (Identity Urgency) + BCH data: other customers buying influences undecided customers

**Structure:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): "3 cycles left this week."
  Visual: The showroom. Physical cycles. Count them on camera.
  Text: "STOCK UPDATE — This Week"

Beat 2 (3-12s): SHOW who bought this week
  "Monday: software engineer from HSR bought the Street Mamba."
  "Tuesday: college student from Koramangala — Sherpa Z1."
  "Wednesday: couple from Indiranagar — Flex GO for metro last-mile."
  Visual: Quick cuts of REAL deliveries (if filmed), or the physical cycles leaving the showroom.

Beat 3 (12-20s): THE SOCIAL PROOF CASCADE
  "That's 7 Bangalore commuters who switched THIS WEEK."
  "Same ORR. Same traffic. Same frustration. They just stopped waiting."
  Visual: Map of Bangalore with pins where buyers are from (Jayanagar, HSR, Koramangala, etc.)

Beat 4 (20-30s): THE GATE
  "We get new stock on [day]. If the model you want is here, it's here. If it's not — wait list."
  "DM 'STOCK' to check if your model is in."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | Stock changes weekly"
```

**Why it converts:** This isn't fake scarcity. It's real social proof with real urgency. The viewer sees PEOPLE LIKE THEM (same neighborhoods, same commutes) who already made the decision. The neighborhood pins create "proximity urgency" — "someone from MY area already bought."

---

#### CM-8: THE COMPARISON DESTROYER
**Purpose:** Help the viewer who's comparing options. They're already in the consideration phase — they just need a clear winner.
**Based on:** Purchase Trigger #6 (Anchoring) + BCH playbook: comparison = highest conversion format

**Structure:**
```
Beat 1 (0-3s): "E-cycle vs. [competitor/alternative]. Which one?"
  Visual: Two products side by side. The comparison is the hook.
  Text: "[Product A] vs. [Product B] — Which wins?"

Beat 2 (3-15s): THE HONEST COMPARISON
  Go spec by spec. Be HONEST — acknowledge where the competitor wins.
  Honesty builds trust faster than hype.
  "They have a slightly lighter frame. We have 25 km more range."
  "They cost Rs. 5,000 less. But our battery is Samsung cells with 2-year warranty."

Beat 3 (15-22s): THE VERDICT
  "For Bangalore commute specifically? [Winner] because [Bangalore-specific reason]."
  "Those extra 25 km mean you can do Whitefield to Koramangala roundtrip on one charge."

Beat 4 (22-30s): THE GATE
  "Still confused? Come test ride both. We have [competitor] alternatives too."
  "DM 'COMPARE' — tell us what you're choosing between."
  Text: "BCH Jayanagar | Test ride before you decide"
```

**Comparison targets for Next.BLR:**
- E-cycle vs. Activa/scooter (the big switch)
- E-cycle vs. regular cycle (the upgrade)
- AOKI vs. EMotorad (direct competitor)
- AOKI vs. Hero Lectro (budget competitor)
- E-cycle vs. Uber/Ola monthly spend (the math comparison)

**Why it converts:** Comparison shoppers are the CLOSEST to buying. They've already decided to buy SOMETHING — they just need help choosing. This content catches them at the decision point and pulls them to BCH.

### The Conversion Magnet Master Formula

```
CONVERSION MAGNET =
  (Pattern Interrupt × TG Relevance)          ← gets the right person to stop scrolling
  × (Purchase Trigger × Proof Density)         ← attacks a specific buying barrier with evidence
  × (Time Anchor × Friction Removal)           ← creates urgency + makes the next step dead simple
  + (Co-Decision Ammunition)                   ← gives the viewer something to forward
```

**Score each element 1-10. Multiply the first three pairs. Add the last.**
- **Above 600:** Will drive store visits. Shoot immediately.
- **400-599:** Needs one element upgraded. Find the weakest pair.
- **Below 400:** Won't convert. Rework before shooting.

---

### Conversion Magnet Concept Creation Process

**Step 1: Pick the Buying Barrier**
Which of the 5 barriers does this concept attack?
- [ ] Value ("Is it worth it?")
- [ ] Fit ("Will it work for MY life?")
- [ ] Risk ("What if something goes wrong?")
- [ ] Social ("What will people think?")
- [ ] Action ("Where do I even start?")

**Step 2: Pick the Purchase Trigger**
Which of the 7 triggers powers this concept?
- [ ] Self-Projection (show someone LIKE them using it)
- [ ] Emotional Ownership (make them feel they already own it)
- [ ] Specific Social Proof (exact numbers, exact people, exact places)
- [ ] Loss Framing (make NOT buying feel like the loss)
- [ ] Bridge Moment (tension → product → resolution)
- [ ] Price Anchoring (reframe the price to feel small)
- [ ] Identity Urgency (pressure the self-image, not the wallet)

**Step 3: Pick the Conversion Magnet Type**
Which of the 8 CM types fits?
- [ ] CM-1: First Reaction (test ride content)
- [ ] CM-2: Commuter Math (price reframe)
- [ ] CM-3: Objection Autopsy (proof-based objection kill)
- [ ] CM-4: Transformation Witness (real customer before/after)
- [ ] CM-5: Store Experience (preview the visit)
- [ ] CM-6: Co-Decision (ammunition to forward)
- [ ] CM-7: Scarcity Proof (real stock + social proof)
- [ ] CM-8: Comparison Destroyer (vs. alternatives)

**Step 4: Design the 4 Hook Layers (same as regular content)**
- [ ] Visual hook — physical, dramatic, stops scroll
- [ ] Spoken hook — bold opening in Kannada
- [ ] Text hook — on screen by 0:02
- [ ] SFX hook — amplifies the visual

**Step 5: Include the Time Anchor**
What makes them visit THIS week, not "someday"?
- [ ] Limited test ride slots ("5 slots this Saturday")
- [ ] Stock scarcity ("3 Flex GOs left")
- [ ] Follower-exclusive window ("this deal ends Sunday")
- [ ] Event tie-in ("Bangalore cycling day this weekend")

**Step 6: Design the Gate**
What specific action does the viewer take?
- [ ] DM '[KEYWORD]' (which keyword?)
- [ ] "Show this Reel at the store for [X]"
- [ ] "Tag [specific person] to come with you"
- [ ] "Save this — bring it to BCH Jayanagar"

**Step 7: Run Kill Tests**
- [ ] **Share Test:** Would the viewer forward this to convince someone?
- [ ] **Save Test:** Would the viewer bookmark this for their visit?
- [ ] **7-Day Test:** Does this create urgency to act within 7 days?
- [ ] **TG Filter:** Does this attract BUYERS, not just viewers?
- [ ] **Tata Ace Test:** If this goes viral, will the viral viewers be potential customers?
- [ ] **Store Visit Test:** After watching, does the viewer know WHERE to go, WHEN to go, and WHAT to ask for?

[ ] Proof Density: __/10
[ ] Escalation: __/10

CONVERSION SPECIFICS:
[ ] Time Anchor present? Y/N (must be Y)
[ ] Specific model + price shown? Y/N (must be Y)
[ ] DM keyword or gate action clear? Y/N (must be Y)
[ ] Store location + hours visible? Y/N (must be Y)
[ ] Co-decision friendly? (can be forwarded to convince someone) Y/N

KILL TESTS:
[ ] Forward Test: PASS / FAIL
[ ] Save Test: PASS / FAIL
[ ] 7-Day Test: PASS / FAIL

## Key Principles

**1. The magnet works because it's the exception, not the rule.**
If every video is a magnet, viewers learn to ignore the gate. Magnet content = surprise. Routine kills it.

**2. Regular content builds the BRAND. Conversion magnets drive the REVENUE.**
75% regular, 25% magnet (split across all 3 levels). Both are necessary.

**3. The store is the closer. Content is the opener.**
88% conversion rate at the store means your content's ONLY job is to get them through the door within 7 days.

**4. Proof > promises. Physical > verbal. Specific > general.**
Show the battery meter. Stack the cash. Film the real customer. Name the neighborhood. Every conversion magnet lives or dies on proof density.

**5. Every conversion magnet must answer: "Where do I go, when, and what do I ask for?"**
If the viewer finishes the Reel and doesn't know these 3 things, the magnet failed.
