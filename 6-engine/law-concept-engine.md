## HOW IT WORKS

```
INPUT (idea / pain point / format)
       ↓
PHASE 1: Classify — pillar, product, TG slice
       ↓
PHASE 2: Law Selection — pick 5-10 laws from the 292
       ↓
PHASE 3: Hook Generation — laws → 4-layer hook
       ↓
PHASE 4: Body Generation — laws → 4-beat body
       ↓
PHASE 5: CTA — standard 2-layer formula
       ↓
PHASE 6: Validation — 30-law score + 12-point hook + kill tests + I×E×S
       ↓
OUTPUT: Full NB concept (shoot-ready)

## PHASE 1: CLASSIFY

Before generating, answer three questions:

| Question | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Pillar?** | Commuter Pain / Lifestyle Identity / Price Shock / Family Emotion / Product Hero / Brand Building |
| **Product?** | AOK / E-cycle (specific model) / General BCH |
| **TG Slice?** | Not just "Bangalore commuter 25-40" — pick the PSYCHOGRAPHIC slice: |

### TG Psychographic Slices

| Slice | Core Motivation | Strongest Laws |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Parking Rage** | "I spent 20 min finding parking AGAIN" | Trigger Frequency, Escalation, PAS |
| **Petrol Grief** | "My petrol bill is my second rent" | Prospect Theory, Human-Scale Stat, Price Shock |
| **Metro Gap Frustration** | "Metro ends 3 km from my office" | Concreteness, Specificity, Sinatra Test |
| **Identity Flex** | "I want to be the smart one who figured it out" | Identity Appeal, Esteem Layer, Social Currency |
| **Fitness Guilt** | "I pay for a gym I never go to" | Misbelief Engine, Versus, Challenge Plot |
| **Time Poverty** | "I lose 2 hours daily to commute" | Sensory Translation, Escalation, Uncommon Sense |
| **Parent Provider** | "I want the best for my kid" | Oxytocin, Mother Teresa, Anti-Authority, Connection Plot |
| **Weekend Explorer** | "Saturday mornings should feel like freedom" | Narrative Transportation, Behavioral Residue, Habitat Expansion |

---

## PHASE 2: LAW SELECTION

Based on Pillar + TG Slice, select 5-10 laws. Use this matrix:

### Law Selection by Pillar

**COMMUTER PAIN (PAS, Absurdist Comedy)**

---

## PHASE 3: HOOK GENERATION (Law → 4 Layers)

Map selected laws to the 4 hook layers:

```
VISUAL ← Which laws dictate what they SEE?
  • Contrast & Affinity (Block) → bright vs dark, moving vs still
  • Movement (Block) → what physical action happens?
  • Ambiguous Space (Block) → can we start unidentifiable?
  • Face + Emotion (Block) → whose face, what emotion?
  • Pattern Interruption (Cron) → what breaks the expected feed?

SPOKEN ← Which laws dictate what they HEAR?
  • Gap Theory (Heath) → the question that MUST be answered
  • Uncommon Sense (Heath) → the surprising version of truth
  • WIIFY (Heath) → "you" / "nee" / "neenu" framing
  • Narrowcasting (Berger) → Bangalore-specific language
  • Proverb Principle (Heath) → compact + profound

TEXT ← Which laws dictate what they READ?
  • Magazine Cover Test (Kane) → 5-7 words max
  • Versus Framework (Cron) → show both sides
  • Concrete Specificity (Heath) → real number, real location
  • Sound-Off Effectiveness (Kane) → carries full hook on mute

SFX ← Which laws dictate what they FEEL?
  • Physiological Arousal (Berger) → create physical response
  • Tone-Emotion Association (Block) → match sound to mood
  • Cortisol Tension (Cron) → build stress/anticipation
```

### Hook Generation Checklist

Before finalizing the hook, verify:
- [ ] All 4 layers point to the SAME message (alignment rule)
- [ ] The body does something dramatic BEFORE the mouth says anything
- [ ] It works on MUTE (text carries full hook)
- [ ] A stranger decodes the premise in under 3 seconds
- [ ] It triggers "wait, what?" (prediction error)

---

## PHASE 4: BODY GENERATION (Law → 4 Beats)

Structure the body as 4 beats, each powered by laws:

### Beat 1 (3-8 sec): GROUND IT
**Laws:** Concreteness (Heath) + Sensory Translation (Heath) + Cause-and-Effect (Cron)
- Make the abstract tangible
- Show the specific situation, number, location
- Connect hook to body seamlessly (one piece, not two)
- New value delivered

### Beat 2 (8-13 sec): BUILD IT
**Laws:** Escalation (Cron) + Cause-and-Effect (Cron) + Visual Progression (Block)
- Stack tension or information
- Each beat more intense than the last
- Visual complexity increases (simple → complex)
- New value delivered

### Beat 3 (13-18 sec): PROVE IT
**Laws:** Sinatra Test (Heath) + Anti-Authority (Heath) + Testable Credentials (Heath) + Vivid Detail (Heath)
- Credibility beat: real proof, real numbers, real person
- One extreme proof point that validates everything
- Specific details that signal authenticity
- New value delivered

### Beat 4 (18-23 sec): FEEL IT
**Laws:** Identity Appeal (Heath) + Feel-First (Cron) + Emotional Peak + Visual Climax (Block)
- Maximum visual intensity (Block: climax = highest contrast)
- Emotional payoff: the viewer feels the transformation
- This is where Identity Appeal lands hardest
- Twist at 65% mark if applicable

### Body Rules
- New VALUE every 3-5 seconds (never repeat)
- Sub-beat at every cut (Block: editorial rhythm)
- Camera match to emotion (handheld = pain, stabilized = freedom)
- "PROMOTING:" line clear — one product/service/offer

---

## PHASE 5: CTA (Standard 2-Layer)

```
LAYER 1 — Video-Specific CTA (3 sec):
  [Action] + [Channel] + [Phone number if applicable]
  Powered by: Commander's Intent (ONE action), Hick's Law (no choice paralysis)

LAYER 2 — Brand Signature CTA (2 sec):
  "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni"
  MANDATORY. Every video. Non-negotiable.
  Powered by: Mere Exposure Effect (repetition builds familiarity), Serial Repetition (signature)
```

**CTA Text Rule:** Persistent CTA banner on screen the ENTIRE video.

---

## PHASE 6: VALIDATION

Run the completed concept through 4 validation layers:

### Layer 1: 30-Law Quick-Score
Use `reference/law-score-template.md`. Must score **25+/30** to proceed.

### Layer 2: 12-Point Hook Score
From `hook/pattern-interruption-hook.md`. Must score **8+/10**.

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Involuntary Attention Capture | /10 |
| Cognitive Disruption | /10 |
| Curiosity Gap | /10 |
| Emotional Micro-Trigger | /10 |
| Platform-Native Twist | /10 |
| Sound-Off Effectiveness | /10 |
| Relevance Bridge | /10 |
| Motion/Kinetics | /10 |
| Contrast/Color | /10 |
| Repetition Resilience | /10 |
| Thumbnail-Hook Alignment | /10 |
| Shareability Signal | /10 |
| **COMPOSITE** | **/10** |

### Layer 3: 6 Kill Tests

| Test | Question | Pass/Fail |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Share** | Who specifically would DM this? What would they say? | |
| **Comment** | What built-in reason is there to comment? | |
| **Memory** | What ONE vivid image sticks? | |
| **Chai** | How would someone describe this at chai in one sentence? | |
| **TG Filter** | Does it attract the RIGHT audience, not just random viewers? | |
| **Tata Ace** | Would viral viewers actually buy? | |

### Layer 4: I×E×S Share Equation

```
I (Identity): Does this say "WHO I AM"?         ___/10
E (Emotion): Peak emotion or just amusement?     ___/10
S (Safety): Zero risk to share or controversial? ___/10

SHARE SCORE: I × E × S = ___
→ 500+ = Viral confirmed
→ 400-499 = Near-viral
→ Below 400 = Won't go viral through shares
```

### Final Gate

| Validation | Minimum | Result |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 30-Law Score | 25+/30 | |
| Hook Score | 8+/10 | |
| Kill Tests | 6/6 pass | |
| Share Score | 400+ | |

**ALL FOUR must pass → concept approved for shooting.**
