# FULL NB SCRIPTS

## NB1-NB20 (Next.BLR Urban Commuter Concepts)

> **Channel:** @next.blr
> **Products:** AOKI e-cycles
> **DM Keyword:** 'NEXT'
> **Brand CTA:** "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni"

## NB1 — THE NIGHT REVEAL

**Pillar:** Product Hero Showcase
**TG:** Urban Bangalore male 25-35, style-conscious, wants something that LOOKS as good as it rides
**Life-Event Hook:** Bangalore evenings — the city transforms at night. Lights, traffic, energy. Your ride should match.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** COMPLETE DARKNESS. A single LED headlight turns ON — blinding into the camera. Slowly, the outline of a cycle emerges from the dark. Frame by frame, light reveals the body.
- **Spoken:** Dead silence for 2 seconds. Then one word: "Beast."
- **On-Screen Text:** Nothing for 2 seconds. Then: "Midnight. Bangalore. One machine."
- **SFX:** Deep bass hum that builds as the light comes on — like a machine powering up

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Light fully reveals the cycle. Slow pan from front wheel to back. Every curve, every detail. Night lighting makes it cinematic. Reflections on the frame.
- **Sec 6-9:** Close-up of the display turning on — numbers lighting up. Range. Speed. Battery. The tech comes alive.
- **Sec 9-12:** Person gets on. Rides into the street. Camera follows from behind — tail light glowing red in the dark. Bangalore street lights streak past.
- **Sec 12-15:** Drone-style shot (or elevated phone angle from above) — the cycle cutting through an empty Bangalore road at night. One rider. One city. Text overlay: model name + starting price.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Built for Bangalore after dark. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — or find us this weekend."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro look at this cycle" — the cinematic reveal makes it shareable as a VISUAL, not just a product
- **Comment:** "What cycle is this?!" / "Price?" — curiosity-driven comments
- **Memory:** "That cycle reel shot at night where the headlight came on and it looked like a bike ad"
- **Chai:** "Have you seen this cycling page? The night shots look insane."
- **TG Filter:** Style-conscious urban Bangalore crowd. The cinematic night aesthetic self-selects the right TG.
- **Tata Ace:** If they're watching a product reveal at night in Bangalore = they live here and want this

**Shoot notes:** MUST shoot after dark. BCH store entrance or nearby street. iPhone 15 Pro Max handles low light well. Start in complete darkness — turn headlight ON as camera rolls. Slo-mo for the light reveal. Use the street/footpath outside for the riding shot. Golden hour or full dark both work.

## NB2 — THE SILK BOARD ESCAPE

**Pillar:** Urban Commute Content
**TG:** Bangalore commuter 25-40 who's DIED inside at Silk Board junction
**Life-Event Hook:** Every Bangalorean has a Silk Board trauma. The junction where time goes to die.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Phone screen showing Google Maps — Silk Board Junction — BRIGHT RED traffic. ETA: 1 hour 45 min. Hand SLAPS the phone face-down on a table.
- **Spoken:** "Silk Board. 1 hour 45 minutes. For 8 kilometers."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Bangalore traffic ruined your evening. Again."
- **SFX:** Car horn chaos (2 seconds of real Bangalore traffic audio) → sudden SILENCE

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Cut to silence. Person walks to their AOK/e-cycle parked at the store entrance. Puts on helmet. Gets on. No cars. No traffic. No honking.
- **Sec 6-9:** Riding footage on an actual Bangalore road (or footpath outside store). Breezing past. Text overlay: "Same 8 km. Same route."
- **Sec 9-12:** Phone held up showing Google Maps — "18 minutes." Then shows the cycle display: battery still at 85%. "18 minutes. Rs.3 of electricity. Zero road rage."
- **Sec 12-15:** Parks at destination (could be store entrance from the other direction). Takes off helmet. Checks watch. Smiles. Text overlay: "1 hour 27 minutes. That's what you saved today."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Next time you're stuck at Silk Board, remember — you chose this. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — your commute is about to change."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** EVERY Bangalorean will share a Silk Board pain reel — it's a shared city trauma
- **Comment:** "What's your worst Silk Board experience?" — unlimited engagement
- **Memory:** "That reel where the cycle did Silk Board in 18 minutes while cars took 1 hour 45"
- **Chai:** "Did you know you can cycle from Silk Board to HSR in 18 minutes? My car takes 2 hours sometimes."
- **TG Filter:** Only Bangalore commuters know Silk Board pain. Non-Bangaloreans scroll past. PERFECT local filter.
- **Tata Ace:** If someone watches a commute comparison to the end = they're calculating their own route

**Shoot notes:** Google Maps screenshot of Silk Board traffic is easy (take a real one during peak hours). Riding footage can be shot on the footpath/street outside the store. The before (phone) vs after (cycle) comparison is all editing. No external location needed.

## NB3 — THE COFFEE RUN

**Pillar:** Lifestyle Integration
**TG:** Urban Bangalore 25-35, cafe culture crowd, weekend riders
**Life-Event Hook:** The Bangalore weekend coffee run — Koramangala to Indiranagar, Third Wave to Blue Tokai. Everyone does it.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** A coffee cup sits on a table. Hand picks it up — takes a SIP — puts it down HARD. Camera pulls back to reveal the person is sitting ON the e-cycle, coffee in one hand, handlebar in the other.
- **Spoken:** "Saturday morning. Oru coffee. Oru ride." (One coffee. One ride.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Saturday 7 AM. Bangalore woke up. Did you?"
- **SFX:** Coffee pour sound → bicycle bell ding

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Riding through morning Bangalore (or just outside the store — early morning, empty streets). Light traffic. Morning light. Peaceful. Text: "No Uber surge. No parking hunt. No petrol queue."
- **Sec 6-9:** Arrives at a "coffee spot" (this can be the store counter with a coffee cup staged). Parks. Locks. "Total commute cost: Rs.2. Total time: 12 minutes. Total stress: 0."
- **Sec 9-12:** Sits with coffee. Cycle parked behind them. The shot is LIFESTYLE — person, coffee, cycle. Not a product shot — a LIFE shot. "This is what Bangalore mornings should feel like."
- **Sec 12-15:** Gets back on the cycle. Rides off. Camera stays. Morning light catches the frame. Beautiful static shot of an empty road.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Your Saturday mornings don't have to start with traffic. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Bangalore cafe crowd shares lifestyle content within their circles — aesthetic + relatable
- **Comment:** "Your go-to Bangalore coffee spot?" — people LOVE sharing their coffee opinions
- **Memory:** "That chill Saturday morning cycle + coffee reel — I want that life"
- **Chai:** "I saw this page — this guy cycles to his coffee spot every Saturday. Costs him Rs. 2."
- **TG Filter:** Urban Bangalore lifestyle crowd self-selects for this content. Not mass. Not everyone. The RIGHT 25-35 urban crowd.
- **Tata Ace:** Lifestyle aspiration content — these people HAVE the spending power for e-cycles

**Shoot notes:** Shoot early morning (6-7 AM) at store entrance or nearby street when it's empty. Prop: one coffee cup. The morning light does all the work. Keep it calm, not energetic — this page's energy is DIFFERENT from BCH Main.

## NB4 — THE WEIGHT TEST

**Pillar:** Product Hero Showcase
**TG:** First-time e-cycle buyer (25-40) worried about e-cycles being heavy and bulky
**Life-Event Hook:** "E-cycles are heavy" — the #1 misconception that stops people from buying

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person stands next to the cycle. LIFTS the entire e-cycle with ONE HAND — holds it up. The cycle HANGS in the air. One hand. No struggle.
- **Spoken:** "Everyone says e-cycles are heavy. Really?"
- **On-Screen Text:** "Too heavy? Watch this."
- **SFX:** Comic "whoooosh" lift sound → dramatic pause while cycle hangs in air

### Body (3-12 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-5:** Still holding it with one hand. "22 kilos. That's 2 buckets of water." Puts it down gently. Solid thud.
- **Sec 5-8:** "Your gym dumbbell is 15 kg. This is 22. With a motor, a battery, and 60 km of range INSIDE it." Pats the frame.
- **Sec 8-10:** Person casually lifts it UP a single step (store entrance step). "Apartment stairs? Elevator? Car boot? Not a problem."
- **Sec 10-12:** Sets it down. Turns it on. Display lights up. "Light enough to carry. Smart enough to carry YOU."

### CTA (12-15 sec)
"Come lift it yourself. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro this guy lifted the e-cycle with one hand" — the visual itself is shareable
- **Comment:** "No way that's 22 kg" / "Which model?" — disbelief = comments
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy held the entire e-cycle up with one hand"
- **Chai:** "Those new e-cycles are only 22 kg apparently. A guy lifted it with one hand."
- **TG Filter:** Only people considering e-cycles care about weight. Addresses the #1 objection.
- **Tata Ace:** Weight concern = purchase barrier. Removing it = unblocking the sale

**Shoot notes:** At store. Need someone strong enough to hold the cycle up with one hand for 3-4 seconds. If the model is 22 kg, this is doable for most fit men. If not one hand, try two hands overhead — still dramatic. The step at the store entrance works for the "carrying upstairs" demo.

## NB5 — THE PARKING MATH

**Pillar:** Urban Commute Content
**TG:** Car/bike owner (28-40) who spends Rs. 3000-5000/month on parking in Bangalore
**Life-Event Hook:** Finding parking in Bangalore — the 20-minute circling, the Rs. 100/day charges, the frustration

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person stands next to a PARKED CAR. Opens the wallet. Pulls out a Rs. 100 note. STICKS IT on the windshield (like a parking fine). Then another Rs. 100. And another. The windshield fills with notes.
- **Spoken:** "Rs.100. Har din. Parking ke liye. Mahine ka Rs.3,000 sirf KHADE REHNE ke liye."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Rs.3,000/month. Just to PARK."
- **SFX:** Paper slapping glass sound with each note → cash register total

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Cut to person PARKING the e-cycle against a pole (or store entrance). Locks it. "Parking cost: Rs.0. Time to find parking: 0 seconds."
- **Sec 6-9:** "Rs.3,000 in parking x 12 months = Rs.36,000 a year. Just. To. Park." Numbers appear on screen.
- **Sec 9-12:** Stands next to the parked cycle. "This cycle COSTS less than 2 years of your car parking." Let that sink in. "And it takes you places. Your parking just... stands there."
- **Sec 12-15:** Gets on the cycle. Rides past the parked car with notes on the windshield. Doesn't look back.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Stop paying rent for your car. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — let's do the math on YOUR commute."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro I literally pay 3K a month parking — send this to every car owner in Bangalore"
- **Comment:** "How much do YOU spend on parking?" — people love ranting about Bangalore parking
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy stuck cash on a car windshield — parking costs more than the cycle"
- **Chai:** "Apparently 2 years of car parking costs more than an entire e-cycle. We're idiots."
- **TG Filter:** Only car/bike owners in Bangalore understand parking pain. Perfect urban commuter filter.
- **Tata Ace:** Anyone watching parking math = they're paying for parking = they have money for an e-cycle

**Shoot notes:** Need access to a parked car — can use a customer's car if available OR shoot just the dashboard/windshield angle without needing the full car. Rs. 100 notes as props (5-6 notes, real or printed). Cycle parking shot at store entrance.

---

## NB6 — THE SUNDAY ROUTE

**Pillar:** Lifestyle Integration
**TG:** Weekend fitness/outdoor enthusiast 25-40, Bangalore
**Life-Event Hook:** The Bangalore weekend dilemma — gym membership you don't use, Strava guilt, saying "I'll start this weekend" every Friday

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Phone shows a STRAVA app with 0 km this week. ZERO. The shame. Person THROWS the phone on a sofa (or counter). Grabs a helmet instead.
- **Spoken:** "3 months of gym membership. Zero visits. But THIS..."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Gym: Rs.15,000/year. Total visits: 4."
- **SFX:** Buzzer sound (like a game show wrong answer) on the Strava zero → upbeat music kicks in

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Person on the e-cycle, riding. Morning light. Bangalore road. "Sunday morning. 15 km ride. Pedal assist level 2 — you still pedal, it just helps."
- **Sec 6-9:** Phone mounted on handlebar showing LIVE stats — distance, calories, speed. "8 km in. 180 calories burned. Not even breathing hard."
- **Sec 9-12:** Stops at a scenic point (store entrance in morning light works). Takes a sip of water. "Your gym membership sits unused. This goes wherever YOU go."
- **Sec 12-15:** Back on the cycle. Riding. "15 km done. 350 calories. That's your daily Starbucks, burned before 8 AM." Shows Strava app now: 15 km completed.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"The best workout is the one you actually DO. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Send this to someone with a gym membership they never use" — EVERYONE knows that person (or IS that person)
- **Comment:** "Be honest — how many times did you go to the gym this month?" — vulnerability comments
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy's Strava was at 0 and he burned 350 calories on a cycle before 8 AM"
- **Chai:** "You know you can burn 350 calories cycling 15 km on those e-cycles? That's better than my gym."
- **TG Filter:** Fitness-curious urban crowd with gym guilt. Not random fitness — CYCLING-specific fitness.
- **Tata Ace:** Gym-guilt + fitness-interest = health-conscious buyers with spending power

**Shoot notes:** Early morning shoot. Phone showing Strava zero (screenshot or stage it). Riding footage on footpath/street outside store. Phone mounted on handlebar for stats shot (use a mount or tape). Morning light is essential for the lifestyle feel.

## NB7 — THE FOLD

**Pillar:** Product Hero Showcase
**TG:** Apartment-dwelling Bangalorean (25-40) with zero storage space
**Life-Event Hook:** "Where will I KEEP it?" — the #2 objection after weight. Bangalore apartments are SMALL.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person FOLDS the e-cycle in one motion — frame collapses, handlebars tuck — it goes from full cycle to half-size in 2 seconds. THUD as it stands folded.
- **Spoken:** "1BHK mein cycle rakhne ki jagah nahi? WATCH."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Your apartment is 500 sqft. Where does the cycle go?"
- **SFX:** Mechanical click-click-LOCK sound as it folds — satisfying engineering sound

### Body (3-12 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-5:** Folded cycle stands next to common objects for size comparison. "Smaller than your suitcase. Fits behind your sofa. Fits in your car boot."
- **Sec 5-8:** Person PICKS IT UP folded and walks with it through a doorway (store entrance). "Take it inside your office. Take it inside the lift. Take it inside the train."
- **Sec 8-10:** UNFOLD — one motion — full cycle again. Ready to ride. "3 seconds to fold. 3 seconds to unfold."
- **Sec 10-12:** Person rides away on the now-unfolded cycle. "500 sqft apartment? Not a problem."

### CTA (12-15 sec)
"Small space, big ride. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — come fold it yourself."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro this cycle FOLDS" — the folding mechanism is inherently shareable/satisfying
- **Comment:** "I NEED this" / "Price?" — product curiosity
- **Memory:** "That cycle that folds in half and fits behind a sofa"
- **Chai:** "There's this folding e-cycle — fits in a 1BHK. My friend showed me the reel."
- **TG Filter:** Only apartment dwellers with space issues care about folding. Urban Bangalore = apartments.
- **Tata Ace:** Storage objection = purchase blocker. Removing it = unblocking the sale

**Shoot notes:** At store. ONLY works if there's a foldable model in stock. The fold-unfold must be smooth — practice before filming. The satisfying click sound can be amplified in editing. Compare folded size to a suitcase or box at the store for reference.

## NB8 — THE LAST MILE

**Pillar:** Urban Commute Content
**TG:** Metro commuter (25-40) dealing with the "last mile" problem — metro station to office/home
**Life-Event Hook:** Bangalore Metro ends. But your destination is 3 km from the station. Auto? Rs. 100. Walk? 30 minutes. Every. Single. Day.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person stands OUTSIDE (imagine metro station exit — actually shot at store entrance). Holds up a hand to flag an auto. Auto drives PAST. Another drives past. Third one stops — "100 rupees." Person's jaw drops.
- **Spoken:** "Metro se utre. 3 km baaki. Auto — Rs.100. Har din. Rs.2,600 mahine ka. SIRF last mile."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Metro done. Last 3 km? Rs.100/day."
- **SFX:** Auto meter beeping sound → comedic fail horn

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Person walks to their e-cycle (folded, leaning against wall). UNFOLDS it. 3 seconds. Gets on.

**Pillar:** Urban Commute / Absurdist Comedy
**TG:** Bangalore car/bike commuter (25-40) who loses sanity in traffic daily
**Emotion:** "This is literally me" → stressed laughter → recognition → want
**Promoting:** Any AOKI e-cycle

### Section 1: Pattern Interruption Visual Hook (0-3 sec)
**Visual:** Person sits in a CHAIR (imaginary car). Glass jar on a table next to them. HONK sounds blare. For EVERY HONK, they drop a coin into the jar. CLINK. CLINK. CLINK. In 5 seconds, the jar is HALF FULL.
**Spoken:** Nothing for 3 seconds. Just honks and coins. Then, quietly: "10 seconds. 12 honks. This is Bangalore."
**Text:** "1 honk = 1 coin. 10 seconds of Bangalore traffic."
**SFX:** Real Bangalore traffic horn chaos → coin clinking on glass → jar filling → jar OVERFLOWING

### Section 2: Body (3-18 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** More coins. Jar OVERFLOWING. Person looks at the pile. DUMPS IT on the table. "Rs.3,500/month in petrol. Rs.2,000/month in rage."
- **Sec 6-9:** Person STANDS UP from the chair. Walks away. Behind the chair: an AOKI e-cycle. Gets on.
- **Sec 9-12:** Rides. Dead silence. No horns. No coins. "Honks on an e-cycle commute? Zero. Rage? Zero. Coins? All in your pocket."
- **Sec 12-15:** Person riding on the footpath. Peaceful. Calm. STARK contrast with first 6 seconds.
- **Sec 15-18:** "Bangalore traffic: 47 honks per kilometer. Your e-cycle commute: just you, the road, and your thoughts."

### Section 3: CTA (18-23 sec)
**CTA:** "Honk free commute start maadi. DM 'NEXT'. Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro this is literally every signal in Bangalore — the coin jar thing is genius"
- **Chai:** "This guy put a coin in a jar for every honk. Jar overflowed in 10 seconds."
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy counted Bangalore honks with coins and the jar overflowed in seconds"
- **Tata Ace:** Traffic rage = daily pain = actively seeking alternatives

**Edit Direction:**
1. ON-SCREEN HOOK TEXT: "1 honk = 1 coin. Bangalore traffic."
2. MUSIC/AUDIO: Real traffic horns (LOUD) → coins clinking → jar dump crash → TOTAL SILENCE → gentle wind
3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: Counter — "Honk #1... #2... #12..." in rapid succession
4. KEYWORD: "Bangalore traffic honking e-cycle silent commute"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: Sound design is EVERYTHING. Chaos → silence contrast is the viral hook.

## NB20 — THE RESIGNATION LETTER

**Hook Score:** 9.0/10
**Pillar:** Urban Commute / Genre Mismatch Comedy
**TG:** Bangalore working professional (25-40) who fantasizes about quitting the commute struggle
**Emotion:** "Wait, what is he doing?" → laughter → "I FELT that" → share
**Promoting:** Any AOKI e-cycle

### Section 1: Pattern Interruption Visual Hook (0-3 sec)
**Visual:** Close-up of a hand WRITING on paper. Formal. Slow. Camera reveals: "Dear Bangalore Traffic, I hereby submit my resignation, effective immediately." SIGNS it with a dramatic flourish. Folds it. SLAMS palm on it.
**Spoken:** "Dear Bangalore Traffic. I quit."
**Text:** "He wrote a resignation letter. To Bangalore traffic."
**SFX:** Pen on paper scratching → paper fold → palm SLAM → dramatic bass drop

### Section 2: Body (3-18 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Person reads the letter dramatically: "I resign from: Silk Board junction. ORR crawl. Marathahalli signal. KR Puram underpass." Each location = text popping on screen.
- **Sec 6-9:** "I resign from: Surge pricing during rain. Auto drivers who refuse. Petrol receipts that make me cry."
- **Sec 9-12:** "My last working day in Bangalore traffic was... YESTERDAY." THROWS the letter. Walks to the e-cycle. Helmet on.
- **Sec 12-15:** RIDES. Empty road. Calm. Free. "Notice period: zero days."
- **Sec 15-18:** Riding away. Getting smaller. Text: "AOKI e-cycle. Your resignation from Bangalore traffic. Starting at Rs.34,999."

### Section 3: CTA (18-23 sec)
**CTA:** "Bangalore traffic ge resignation kodi. DM 'NEXT'. Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "I WANT TO WRITE THIS LETTER" — every Bangalore commuter wants to resign from traffic. MASSIVE share trigger.
- **Chai:** "This guy wrote a resignation letter to Bangalore traffic and cycled away."
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy resigned from Bangalore traffic — 'Dear Silk Board junction, I quit'"
- **Tuesday:** Stuck at Silk Board → "I should resign from this"
- **TG Filter:** ONLY Bangalore commuters understand these specific location names.
- **Tata Ace:** If they laugh at Silk Board + ORR + Marathahalli references = they live here = buyer

**Edit Direction:**
1. ON-SCREEN HOOK TEXT: "He resigned. From Bangalore traffic."
2. MUSIC/AUDIO: Formal piano → dramatic reading → letter throw → upbeat freedom music
3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: Handwritten/typewriter font for resignation text
4. KEYWORD: "Bangalore traffic resign e-cycle commute Silk Board"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: The writing close-up must look REAL. Location names must appear as text. Letter throw = slo-mo.

## NB22 — SMALL NOTES

**Pillar:** Family Emotion
**TG:** Parents 28-45, single-income households, kids 10-15
**Life-Event Hook:** The billing counter — where how you PAY tells your whole story
**Laws Used:** Oxytocin Bridge, Mother Teresa, Feel-First, Anti-Authority, Cortisol Tension, Narrative Transportation, Uncommon Sense, Postdictable Surprise, Pattern Interruption
**Content Type:** Emotional Transformation | **Shape:** J-Curve | **Duration:** 30-40 sec
**Channel:** Wattsonwheelz | 7996994427

### THE CONCEPT IN ONE SENTENCE
A mother pays Rs.56,000 in crumpled small notes at the billing counter — the cashier starts counting and it takes SO LONG that the whole store goes quiet.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** BCH billing counter. A woman drops a THICK cloth bundle on the counter. It THUDS. The cashier opens it — a flood of Rs.100s, Rs.50s, Rs.20s, even coins spill out. Not neat stacks. Crumpled. Folded. Some smoothed out, some not. The sheer VOLUME of small notes is the visual.
- **Spoken:** Nothing from her. Cashier looks up. Pauses. Then quietly starts counting.
- **On-Screen Text:** "She paid Rs.56,000. In small notes."
- **SFX:** The THUD of the bundle. Then just the flip-flip-flip of notes being counted.

### Body (3-30 sec)
- **Sec 3-8:** Cashier counting. It's taking time. The woman stands still — not embarrassed, not apologizing. Her kid is next to her holding the Doodle handlebar, not understanding why this moment is heavy. Other customers notice. A man in line behind her shifts his weight. Cashier keeps counting. Nobody rushes her.
- **Sec 8-14:** Staff member walks over. Doesn't say anything. Just starts helping count from the other side of the pile. Two people counting now. The woman watches her money being counted — money she touched every single day for six months. Close-up: a Rs.20 note so worn the edges are soft. A Rs.10 coin with turmeric stain on it (from a pooja?). These notes have LIVES.
- **Sec 14-20:** Count finishes. Cashier looks up. "Exact aagide, ma'am." (It's exact, ma'am.) She doesn't smile. She just nods once. Like she knew. Because she counted it every night. She turns to her kid. Touches his chin. "Hogona." (Let's go.) Kid grabs the Doodle. Walks out. She follows.
- **Sec 20-27:** The man who was in line watches her leave. He looks at the cashier. Cashier looks back. Neither says anything. Cut to: exterior. Kid on the Doodle. Mom walking beside him. He's already 10 feet ahead, riding slow so she can keep up. She doesn't call him back. She just walks. Text: "Rs.56,000. Rs.300 a day. 187 days. She didn't miss one."
**PROMOTING:** EMotorad Doodle — BCH Yelahanka

### CTA (27-32 sec)

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Watch this and try not to feel something" — DM to spouse/parent group
- **Comment:** "Respect" / "That worn Rs.20 note broke me" / "EMI option?"
- **Memory:** The PILE of small notes on the billing counter. The turmeric-stained coin.
- **Chai:** "This woman paid 56K for her kid's cycle in small notes. The whole store went quiet."
- **TG Filter:** Parents who know what saving Rs.300/day feels like.
- **Tata Ace:** Every parent watching this wants to be that parent. They'll visit.

### Validation Scores
- 30-Law: 29/30 | Hook: 9.0/10 | Kill: 6/6 | IxExS: 9 x 10 x 9 = **810**
- **SHOOT**

### Edit Direction
1. ON-SCREEN HOOK TEXT: "She paid Rs.56,000. In small notes."
2. MUSIC/AUDIO: ZERO music. Note-counting ASMR. Silence does the work.
3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: Minimal white. Only 2 text moments — hook + "187 days."
4. KEYWORD: "Doodle electric cycle Bangalore"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: Close-up on the NOTES — worn edges, folds, coin details. The money tells her story. DO NOT show her face crying. She's NOT sad. She's certain. That certainty IS the emotion.

### Shoot Notes
Real customer or recreated with real small notes. The THUD of the bundle on counter is the hook sound. Camera: 2 angles — billing counter close-up + kid-with-Doodle wide. The man in line watching = real customer in store (don't cast). Cashier's "Exact aagide" = real staff, coached on just that one line. Everything else: capture, don't direct.

## NB23 — THE KID WHO ALREADY KNEW

**Pillar:** Social Proof + Emotion
**TG:** Parents 30-45 planning birthday gifts
**Life-Event Hook:** The kid who doesn't need a surprise because he's been staring at this cycle for months — on your own videos
**Laws Used:** Dopamine Delay, Behavioral Residue, Uncommon Sense, Feel-First, Gap Theory, Sinatra Test, Identity Appeal, Physiological Arousal, Oxytocin Bridge
**Content Type:** Emotional Transformation | **Shape:** Ascending Staircase | **Duration:** 25-35 sec
**Channel:** Wattsonwheelz | 7996994427

### THE CONCEPT IN ONE SENTENCE
Kid walks into BCH, goes STRAIGHT to the Doodle without asking anyone, sits on it, and says to his stunned dad — "Appa, idu. 6 months nodu videos nodi idini." (Dad, this one. I've been watching videos of this for 6 months.)

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** A kid walks into BCH. Doesn't look around. Doesn't browse. BEELINES through 300 cycles to one specific cycle. Sits on it. Like he's done this before. But he's never been here.
- **Spoken:** Father behind him: "Aye, nillappa, nillappa—" (Hey wait, wait—)
- **On-Screen Text:** "He'd never been to our store."
- **SFX:** Store ambient — chatter, bells — then a sharp CUT to silence when kid sits.

### Body (3-25 sec)
- **Sec 3-7:** Father catches up. Confused. "Ninage hege gottu idu?" (How do you know this one?) Kid doesn't look up. He's adjusting the seat. Checking the display. Touching the throttle. He KNOWS this cycle. Staff watching, amused.
- **Sec 7-13:** Staff walks over. "Sir, your son has come straight to the Doodle V2." Father: "Naanu yenu helilla ivnige." (I didn't tell him anything.) Staff: "Ivnu nam videos nodi irbeku." (He must've watched our videos.) Kid finally looks up. Matter-of-fact: "6 tinglu. Ella video nodi idini." (6 months. I've watched every video.) Father's face: somewhere between proud and shook.
- **Sec 13-19:** Kid demonstrates to his OWN DAD. Points to features like a salesman. "Idhu hydraulic disc brake. Range 80 km. Throttle illi, pedal assist illi." Staff is trying not to laugh. Father looks at staff like "is my son working here?" Other customers overhear and start watching.
- **Sec 19-23:** Father: long pause. Looks at kid. Looks at staff. Back at kid. "Yeshtu?" (How much?) Kid, INSTANTLY, without missing a beat: "Rs.56,000. But EMI option ide, Appa." (Rs.56,000. But there's an EMI option, Dad.) Staff LOSES it. Father rubs his face. He's buying this cycle today.

### CTA (23-28 sec)
"Your kid already knows what they want. 7996994427. Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Parent → parent: "THIS IS MY KID." Kids share to friends: "Me at a cycle shop"
- **Comment:** "The EMI line killed me" / "Kid is better than the salesman" / "Which model?"
- **Memory:** Kid rattling off specs to his own dad. "EMI option ide, Appa."
- **Chai:** "This kid walked into a cycle shop, went straight to one cycle, and told his dad the price AND the EMI option."
- **TG Filter:** Parents whose kids nag for specific things = exact buyer.
- **Tata Ace:** Kid has already pre-sold the parent. Store visit = closing.

### Validation Scores

- **SHOOT**

### Edit Direction
1. ON-SCREEN HOOK TEXT: "He'd never been to our store."
2. MUSIC/AUDIO: Store ambient only. The dialogue IS the audio. Zero music.
3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: Customer Moment / Comedy-proof
4. KEYWORD: "Doodle electric cycle kids Bangalore"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: Kid must feel NATURAL, not coached. The comedy is his certainty vs dad's confusion. EMI punchline = the closer. If real kid does this, capture it. If recreated, cast a kid who actually knows the specs.

### Shoot Notes
Location: BCH Yelahanka interior. Camera follows kid from entrance. Handheld, documentary style. If this is a real customer interaction, recreate with that family. The humor comes from the kid being MORE prepared than the dad. Staff reactions must be real.

## NB24 — THATHA'S TEST RIDE

**Pillar:** Family Emotion + Comedy
**TG:** Joint families, multi-gen households, parents who need elder buy-in
**Life-Event Hook:** The joint family veto — one old man's "no" that stops everything. Until he sits on the thing.
**Laws Used:** Challenge Plot, Postdictable Surprise, Physiological Arousal, Uncommon Sense, Pattern Interruption, Feel-First, Gap Theory, Narrative Transportation, Dopamine Delay, Oxytocin Bridge
**Content Type:** PAS Comedy Pivot | **Shape:** J-Curve | **Duration:** 35-45 sec
**Channel:** BCH Main | 9380097119

### THE CONCEPT IN ONE SENTENCE
Grandpa comes to BCH to say NO — arms crossed, mundu tucked, full "I'm the elder" energy. Staff dares him to try one ride. He gets on. He won't get off. He's now doing laps. Family is recording. He asks for a different color.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** An older man in a checked shirt and mundu walks into BCH like he's walking into a courtroom. Behind him: his son, daughter-in-law, grandkid — all looking nervous. Grandpa is the judge. Arms crossed. Chin up. Zero smiles.
- **Spoken:** Grandpa (loud, Kannada, to staff): "Rs.56,000 cycle-aa? Nanna kaal-alli naan 3 rupayi-ge cycle odi idde." (Rs.56,000 cycle? In my time I rode a cycle for 3 rupees.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Thatha came to say NO."
- **SFX:** Courtroom gavel sound. (Deliberately over-the-top.)

### Body (3-35 sec)
- **Sec 3-9:** Staff doesn't argue. Doesn't pitch. Just wheels out a Doodle. Parks it in front of grandpa. Says nothing. Grandpa looks at it like it personally offended him. Walks around it. Flicks the handlebar. Squeezes the brake. "Plastic." Kid in the background: dying inside. Father: avoiding eye contact with everyone.
- **Sec 9-16:** Staff, casual: "Sir, ondu ride haaki noodi. Ishtaagilla andre, neev correct. Naavy wrong." (Just try one ride. If you don't like it, you're right and we're wrong.) Grandpa looks at the family. At the cycle. Grunts. Sits on it. His mundu gets stuck. Son rushes to help. Grandpa swats him away. "Naan maadtini!" (I'll do it!) He's on the Doodle. Feet still on the ground. Dignity intact.
- **Sec 16-24:** He twists the throttle. Wrong grip. Staff adjusts his hand. Grandpa twists again. THE DOODLE MOVES. Grandpa's face: eyebrows go UP. Mouth opens SLIGHTLY. A quiet "Oh." Then — he's moving. Slowly. Then faster. He reaches the end. Does he stop? NO. He TURNS AROUND AND COMES BACK. Then goes AGAIN. Third lap. He's grinning now. The kid starts SCREAMING. Father looks at his wife. She's already recording.
- **Sec 24-32:** Grandpa rides back. Gets off with more grace than he got on. Straightens his mundu. Adjusts his shirt. Long beat. Grandpa looks at the kid. Looks at the Doodle. Looks at his son. Says: "Ivnig ondu thogo." Beat. "Nange bere color iddha?" (Get one for him. Do you have a different color for me?)

The family ERUPTS. Kid jumps. Father's jaw drops. Mother starts laughing. Staff breaks. Text: "From NO to TWO."

### Validation Scores

- **SHOOT**

### Edit Direction
1. ON-SCREEN HOOK TEXT: "Thatha came to say NO."
2. MUSIC/AUDIO: Courtroom gavel → store ambient → silence during ride → family eruption audio raw
3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: Comedy-family / "From NO to TWO" at punchline — BOLD
4. KEYWORD: "electric cycle family Yelahanka Bangalore"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: Grandpa's mundu getting stuck = don't cut it. The mess IS the comedy. 3 laps = show all 3 (speed up middle one). The "bere color" punchline must land with a BEAT of silence before it. Film wide during family eruption.

### Shoot Notes
Location: BCH Yelahanka interior + test area. Best case: REAL grandpa customer. Ask staff to watch for joint families. If casting: find a real older man who can ride. The mundu getting stuck is NOT scripted — if it happens, KEEP IT. The "bere color" line can be coached. Camera: wide + face close-up. Face close-up during first throttle twist is the money shot.

**FORMAT: REPEATABLE — "First Twist" series**

### THE CONCEPT IN ONE SENTENCE
Compilation of kids' faces the EXACT millisecond pedal assist kicks in — every face is different, every face is the same sale.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** TIGHT on a kid's face. Sitting on a Doodle, feet on ground. Looks bored. Then — body JERKS backward slightly. Eyes blow open. Something just happened that his brain didn't expect. FREEZE FRAME on that exact face.
- **Spoken:** The kid, frozen frame, delayed: "WHOA—"
- **On-Screen Text:** "The face. Every. Single. Kid."
- **SFX:** Electric motor WHIRR (brief, punchy) → silence on freeze frame

### Body (3-22 sec)
- **Sec 3-6 (KID #1 — UNFREEZE):** Freeze ends. The "WHOA" continues. He's moving. Gripping hard. Laughing. Looks back at dad — "APPA!" Rides away. Cut HARD.
- **Sec 6-9 (KID #2 — THE SILENT ONE):** Girl. Twists. Moves forward. Doesn't scream. Her mouth slowly opens. Eyes get wider. She looks down at the cycle like it betrayed the laws of physics. Whispers: "How." Cut.
- **Sec 9-12 (KID #3 — THE NEGOTIATOR):** Kid rides 5 seconds. Stops. Gets off. Walks to his father. Dead serious. "Appa, idu beku. Discuss madona." (Dad, I need this. Let's discuss.) Father looks at staff. Staff shrugs. Cut.
- **Sec 12-16 (RAPID MONTAGE — 1 sec each):** FOUR faces. Freeze-frame. Unfreeze. Different kids, same moment. Joy. Shock. Disbelief. One kid's glasses slip off his nose. One kid grabs the staff member's arm. One kid starts narrating like a YouTuber: "Guys, this is INSANE."
- **Sec 16-20 (THE CLOSER):** Last kid. Smallest one. Barely reaches the handlebar. Twists. The Doodle crawls forward at minimum speed. His face: the BIGGEST reaction of all. Turns to his mom. Eyes WET. Not sad. Overwhelmed. He whispers: "Amma, naan fly maadtaidini." (Mom, I'm flying.) Mom's hand covers her mouth.

3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: Compilation / Freeze-frame timestamps
4. KEYWORD: "Doodle test ride kids electric cycle"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: Freeze frame EVERY kid at the EXACT moment of first motion. Not before, not after — the millisecond. The "fly" kid is the emotional anchor — place last. The "negotiate" kid is the comedy anchor — place mid. Glasses slipping = don't miss it.

### Shoot Notes
CAPTURE FORMAT: Mount a phone at kid-face-level on the test ride area. Film EVERY first ride over 2-3 Saturdays. You'll get 30-50 takes. Pick the 7-8 best. The "negotiator" kid and the "fly" kid may not happen — capture everything and let the real moments dictate the edit. Never ask a kid to react bigger. The tiny kid's "fly" line — if it happens naturally, that's your closer. If not, find whatever real moment is the most devastating. Staff should say the same thing to every kid before the ride: "Ready?" That's the only scripted beat.

## NB26 — THE HAND

**Pillar:** Family Emotion
**TG:** Fathers 30-45, Bangalore, the man who shows love through action, not words
**Life-Event Hook:** The thing Indian fathers do instead of saying "I'm proud" — the hand on the head, the shoulder squeeze, the nod

**Content Type:** Emotional Transformation | **Shape:** J-Curve | **Duration:** 25-35 sec
**Channel:** BCH Main | 9380097119

### THE CONCEPT IN ONE SENTENCE
A father watches his son ride a cycle for the first time. He says nothing the entire video. The only sound is his son shouting "APPA, NOOO!" and the only action is his hand — reaching out and landing on his son's head when the kid comes back.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** A man's back. He's standing at the edge of BCH's test area. Hands in pockets. Watching something. We can't see what. Shoulders slightly tense. He shifts his weight. We see NOTHING of what he's watching. Only him from behind.
- **Spoken:** From off-screen, distant: "APPAAA! NODUU!" (DAAAD! LOOK!)
- **On-Screen Text:** Nothing. For 3 full seconds. Zero text. (Bold choice. Trust the image.)
- **SFX:** Wind. That's it. Wind and a kid's voice far away.

### Body (3-25 sec)
- **Sec 3-7:** Camera slowly moves around the father. We start to see his profile. He's watching his son ride. The kid is far away — small in the frame. Wobbly at first. Then finding balance. Then speed. The father's jaw clenches. Then unclenches. His hand comes out of his pocket. Then goes back in. He wants to do something. He doesn't.
- **Sec 7-13:** The kid rides better. Faster. Turns around. Heading back. The kid is shouting — just joy noises. Father doesn't move. But his eyes: tracking his son like a hawk. A cut to his hand — it's out of the pocket now. Hanging at his side. Fingers slightly open. He doesn't know he's doing it.
- **Sec 13-19:** Kid stops in front of father. Breathing hard. Grinning. Sweat on his forehead. "Appa, ond baar ride haakdhe! Naan maadidhe!" (Dad, I rode it! I did it!) Father looks at him. Long beat. One. Two. Three seconds of just looking. Then — the hand. It rises. Lands on the kid's head. Not a pat. A HOLD. Fingers curling into the kid's hair. The kid goes still. He feels it. They both feel it. No words.
- **Sec 19-23:** Camera pulls out. Wide shot. Father's hand on kid's head. Kid holding the Doodle handlebar. BCH store behind them. Bangalore evening light. The image holds for 3 full seconds. No cut. No text. Just the frame. Then, softly: "Appa, thogona?" (Dad, should we get it?) Father, still holding his head: "Hmm." That's all. "Hmm."

Text appears: "Some fathers don't say it. They just... hold."

5. SPECIAL NOTES: Camera starts BEHIND the father (face hidden). Slow reveal of his profile. The hand leaving the pocket = most important shot — camera must catch it. The wide hold at the end = 3 seconds MINIMUM, no cuts. Fight the urge to add music. The emptiness is what makes it hit. Color grade: warm, golden, slightly desaturated.

### Shoot Notes
Location: BCH Yelahanka test area, golden hour (5:30-6:30 PM). The father's back must be lit from the side. The kid riding in background should be slightly overexposed (dreamlike). Camera: Primary = telephoto (zoomed in on father from a distance — he shouldn't feel the camera). Secondary = wide for the final held shot. Talent: A REAL father. Don't tell him "we're filming your face." Film from a distance during an actual test ride. Ask permission after. If casting: find a man who is genuinely quiet/reserved. Give him NO direction other than "watch your son ride." Everything he does will be real. The hand-on-head moment — if it doesn't happen organically, don't force it. Film 5-6 fathers. One of them will do it. That's your reel.
