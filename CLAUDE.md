## Files by Folder (in creation flow order)
**1-profile/ — Step 1: Know the product + audience (read FIRST)**
- `1-profile/product-bible.md` — product details, pricing, features, USPs
- `1-profile/tg-deep-profile.md` — target audience deep profile, psychographics
- `1-profile/customer-stories.md` — real stories, triggers (THE GOLDMINE — fill weekly)
- `1-profile/objective.md` — objective goals for creating concepts
- `1-profile/cast-and-crew.md` — 15+ talent roster, gear list, quick casting cheat sheet
- `1-profile/shoot-resources.md` — locations, props (owned + to buy), equipment, editing capabilities. Every concept must be shootable against this inventory.
**2-feedback/ — Step 2: Learn from past**
- `2-feedback/video-feedback.md` — post-publish performance + learnings
- `2-feedback/concept-feedback.md` — review notes (approved/rejected reasons)
- `2-feedback/audience-feedback.md` — DM reactions, comments, shares patterns
**3-data/ — Steps 3–4: Performance data + competition**
- `3-data/our-content/*.json` — our own video performance data (drop JSONs here)
- `3-data/competition/*.json` — competitor video analysis (drop JSONs here)
- `3-data/README.md` — extraction rules: how Claude mines patterns from JSONs
**competitive-intel/ — Competitor analysis (growing reference)**
- `competitive-intel/competitive-intel.md` — competitor strategy, positioning, gaps
- Drop new competitor analyses here as you study more brands
**4-inspiration/ — Step 5: Formats + timing triggers**
- `4-inspiration/cross-pollination-library.md` — hooks from other niches

- `4-inspiration/viral-reference-library.md` — decoded viral videos for reusable templates
**5-ideas/ — Step 6: Idea generation from objective**
- `5-ideas/ideas-0.md` — raw idea bank generated from objective. One-liner seeds before they become full concepts. Tracks content mix (Buying-Decision 40-50% / Identity-Entertainment 30-35% / Magnet 15-20%). Filename ends with total idea count.
- **Rule:** Generate ideas BEFORE creating full concepts. Ideas come from the objective, then the engine turns them into scripts.
**6-engine/ — Step 7: Concept formulas + systems**
- `6-engine/BCH-master-concept-formula.md` — THE scoring + creation bible
- `6-engine/law-concept-engine.md` — law-powered concept generation (292 laws → NB concept in 7 phases)

- `6-engine/research/` — 7 deep-dive source files that feed the 402 laws (scroll-stopping, visual psychology, India consumer behavior, pricing psychology, brand trust, objection+social proof+urgency, DM+retargeting+seasonal+measurement)
**7-rules/ — Step 8: Guardrails**
- `7-rules/global-rules.md` — 34 rules from 14 sessions (approved/rejected patterns, kill tests)
- `7-rules/content-philosophy.md` — owner's philosophy, 6 CTA types, kill tests, concept creation checklist
**8-concepts/ — Step 9: Existing concepts (check dupes)**
- `8-concepts/0-approved-0.md` — approved concepts ready to shoot (0 concepts).
- `8-concepts/10-pending-43.md` — concepts awaiting review (43 concepts).
- **Rule:** Filename always ends with the total concept count. When concepts are added/moved, rename the file (e.g. `0-approved-5.md`, `10-pending-48.md`). Update these descriptions too.
**9-validation/ — Step 10: Checklists + scoring**
- `9-validation/script-checklist-rules.md` — 24-point checklist, 3-layer hook system, edit direction template

**11-tracking/ — Post-production**
- `11-tracking/shoot-done.md` — shot tracking

## Concept Generation Flow
**Before generating, always ask:** New concept or extending NB series? Commuter pain or lifestyle identity? Trending formats?
10K followers. Magnet content proven. Now optimize for buying-decision content alongside follower growth.
Also read `6-engine/magnet-content-framework.md` when creating magnet concepts.

1. Read `1-profile/product-bible.md` + `1-profile/tg-deep-profile.md` + `1-profile/customer-stories.md` + `1-profile/objective.md` + `1-profile/cast-and-crew.md` + `1-profile/shoot-resources.md` (fresh fuel + constraints)
2. Read `2-feedback/` folder — video-feedback, concept-feedback, audience-feedback (learn from past)
3. Read ALL `3-data/our-content/*.json` — extract winning patterns (top hooks, emotions, durations, Bangalore triggers)
4. Read ALL `3-data/competition/*.json` — extract stealable formats + mechanics (see `3-data/README.md` for extraction rules)
5. Read `4-inspiration/cross-pollination-library.md` + `4-inspiration/life-event-calendar.md` (format + timing)
6. **Generate ideas** into `5-ideas/ideas-*.md` — one-liner seeds driven by the objective. Check content mix ratio (Buying-Decision 40-50% / Identity-Entertainment 30-35% / Magnet 15-20%). Check existing ideas to avoid duplicates.
7. **Score each idea** using the 6-step Idea Scoring Workflow (see below). Only ideas that score 25+/30 proceed to full concept.
8. Read `6-engine/BCH-master-concept-formula.md` (proven engine) + `6-engine/law-concept-engine.md` (law-powered generation — pick law stack per pillar, design 4-layer hook from laws). Lookup: `6-engine/300-LAWS-OF-CONVERSION-CONTENT.md` for specific laws during generation. Deep-dive source files in `6-engine/research/`.
9. Read `7-rules/global-rules.md` (34 rules — what gets approved/rejected, kill tests)
10. Check `8-concepts/10-pending-*.md` index for duplicates
11. Generate full concept from idea — then validate against `9-validation/script-checklist-rules.md` (24-point checklist + edit direction template)
Lookup: `10-hook/visual-hook-laws-master.md` — 292 laws reference. Don't read end-to-end; search specific laws when designing hooks.
For deep framework refresh: also read `7-rules/content-philosophy.md`

## Idea Scoring Workflow (Step 7 — run for every idea)
When scoring an idea, execute these 6 steps in order:

**Step 1: Law Scan** — Score the raw idea against `9-validation/law-score-template.md` (30 laws, 0/1 each). Output: score /30 with section breakdown (Attention /10, Curiosity /7, Shareability /7, Story /6).

**Step 2: Hit Analysis** — List every law the idea naturally hits. For each hit, explain WHY this idea activates that law. This shows the idea's strengths.

**Step 3: Gap Analysis** — List every law the idea MISSES. For each miss, explain how to fix it in execution (not by changing the idea — by changing how it's shot/edited/hooked).

**Step 4: 4-Layer Hook Design** — Design the Visual + Spoken + On-Screen Text + SFX layers based on which laws need activation. The hook must cover the gaps identified in Step 3.

**Step 5: System Validation** — Run through 12-point hook score + 6 kill tests (Share, Comment, Memory, Chai, TG Filter, Tata Ace) + I×E×S share equation. Cross-reference against `7-rules/global-rules.md`.

**Step 6: Final Verdict** — SHOOT (25+) / FIX (20-24, list specific fixes) / REWORK (15-19) / KILL (below 15). If FIX: specify which section is weakest and what changes bring it to 25+.

## TG
- Young urban Bangalore commuters ages 22-35
- Techies, startup crowd, metro + last-mile users
- Bangalore-specific pain points: ORR traffic, Koramangala parking, petrol bills, metro gaps
- Identity-motivated: they want to be seen as smart, forward-thinking, city-savvy

## Key Rules
- 3 sections: Pattern Interruption Visual Hook → Hook→Body → Body→CTA
- 4 Hook Layers: Visual + Spoken + On-Screen Text + SFX
- Protagonist = young urban commuter (customer). NOT staff.
- Unreliable Opening always — Bangalore traffic moment, commute frustration, identity flex
- Bangalore specificity = strongest hook lever. Name real locations, real pain.
- 2-Layer CTA: video-specific action + "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni" (MANDATORY every video)
- Language: 85% Kannada / 15% English. Tech/lifestyle = English ok. Commuter pain = Kannada.
- 86.9% non-follower reach — hook must convert cold strangers, not just existing fans.
- Shares > Comments > Views. "This is so Bangalore" = highest share trigger for this TG.
- New concepts go ONLY in `8-concepts/10-pending-*.md`. Never create separate files. Rename file to include new concept count.

## Concept Output Template
Every generated concept MUST include a **Conversion Path** section:
```
### Conversion Path
- Content Type: [Buying-Decision / Identity-Entertainment / Magnet]
- Viewer Action: [Store visit / DM keyword / Save / Share / Follow]
- Conversion Mechanic: [how the video moves the viewer from watching to acting]
- CTA Trigger: [the specific moment in the video that makes the action feel natural]
- Keyword CTA: DM '[WORD]' (if applicable)
```
This replaces "hope they visit" with a designed path: Watch → Feel → Act.

## Master Formula Quick-Reference
Hook scores: Absurdist Comedy 8.6 > Cultural Ref 8.4 > Family Emotion 8.3 > PAS 8.0
Story: PAS Comedy Pivot = 81.5% watch-through (best). Twist at 65% mark. Sub-beat every 3-5s.
Share Score: I×E×S — viral at 500+. Feel-Good highest share rate (1.30%).
Persistent CTA banner on screen the ENTIRE video.

## Session Protocols

### Daily Session Start
At the start of every session where concept generation or data processing is expected:
1. Scan `3-data/our-content/` and `3-data/competition/` for new JSON files (anything beyond `template.json`)
2. List new files found — tell the user what's new
3. Process new JSONs using extraction rules from `3-data/README.md`
4. Build/update pattern summary (top hooks, emotions, stealable formats)
5. Ready for concept generation or whatever the user needs

### Audio Feedback Routing
When the user pastes an audio transcription into chat:
1. Classify the content: video performance / concept review / audience reaction / customer story / rule or preference
2. Extract key points — clean up transcript noise, pull actionable data
3. Route to the correct file:
   - Video performance → `2-feedback/video-feedback.md`
   - Concept review → `2-feedback/concept-feedback.md`
   - Audience reaction → `2-feedback/audience-feedback.md`
   - Customer story → `1-profile/customer-stories.md`
   - Rule/preference → `7-rules/global-rules.md`
4. **Confirm routing with user before writing** — show what goes where, let them approve

### Weekly Research Protocol
When the user triggers weekly research (or asks for it):
1. **Trending formats** — search current Reels/Shorts trends relevant to lifestyle/EV/urban/Bangalore niche
2. **Competitor moves** — analyze any new competitor content, strategy shifts, new brands entering the space
3. **Algorithm updates** — check for Instagram/YouTube platform changes affecting reach/distribution
4. **Update files** — `4-inspiration/`, `competitive-intel/`, `6-engine/` as needed
5. **Flag rule/framework updates** — if research reveals something that should change our rules or engine, propose it

## Debug Checkpoint System
During concept generation, at every flow step transition, Claude MUST output a debug checkpoint before proceeding. This is NOT optional.

### Checkpoint Format
```
┌─ DEBUG: [Step Name] ──────────────────┐
│ Objective Match: X/10                  │
│ TG Alignment: [Yes / Drift detected]  │
│ Product Focus: [On track / Drifting]   │
│ Content Mix: [Within ratio / Off]      │
│ Brand Voice: [Consistent / Drifting]   │
│ VERDICT: PROCEED / STOP               │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When to Run Checkpoints
- **After Tank 4 (Ideate):** Before scoring ideas — does the idea serve the objective? Does content mix allow it?
- **After Tank 5 (Build):** Before applying rules — has the concept drifted from TG, product, or voice?
- **After Tank 6 (Guard):** Before validation — do all kill tests pass? Does it have SOUL?

### STOP Triggers (any one = halt + ask user)
- Objective Match < 7/10 — concept doesn't serve current buying-decision / growth objective
- TG drift — concept doesn't speak to 22-35 Bangalore urban commuter
- Product drift — concept not connected to a specific BCH product (AOK, EMotorad, etc.)
- Content mix violation — ratio already maxed for this content type
- Brand voice drift — too corporate, too generic, not Bangalore enough, not absurd/dark enough

On STOP: Output what's wrong, suggest a fix, ask the user before continuing.

## MEMORY.md Sync Rule
Whenever CLAUDE.md is edited, MEMORY.md must be updated to reflect:
- Any new/changed file paths
- Any new/changed flow steps
- Any new/changed rules or thresholds
- Any new/changed session protocols
MEMORY.md is the human-readable summary. CLAUDE.md is the machine instruction set. They must stay in sync.
