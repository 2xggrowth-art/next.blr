## Concept Generation Flow
**Before generating, always ask:** New concept or extending NB series? Commuter pain or lifestyle identity? Trending formats?
86.9% non-follower reach on 734 followers — content reaches far. Optimize for cold conversion.

1. Read `profile/product-bible.md` + `profile/tg-deep-profile.md` + `profile/customer-stories.md` (fresh fuel)
2. Read `feedback/` folder — video-feedback, concept-feedback, audience-feedback (learn from past)
3. Read `strategy/cross-pollination-library.md` + `strategy/life-event-calendar.md` (format + timing)
4. Read `strategy/BCH-master-concept-formula.md` (proven engine)
5. Read `rules/global-rules.md` (34 rules — what gets approved/rejected, kill tests)
6. Check `concepts/10-pending.md` index for duplicates — NB1-10 exist
7. Generate — then validate against `rules/script-checklist-rules.md` (24-point checklist + edit direction template)
For deep framework refresh: also read `rules/content-philosophy.md`

## TG
- Young urban Bangalore commuters ages 22-35
- Techies, startup crowd, metro + last-mile users
- Bangalore-specific pain points: ORR traffic, Koramangala parking, petrol bills, metro gaps
- Identity-motivated: they want to be seen as smart, forward-thinking, city-savvy

## Key Rules
- 3 sections: Pattern Interruption Visual Hook → Hook→Body → Body→CTA
- 4 Hook Layers: Visual + Spoken + On-Screen Text + SFX
- Protagonist = young urban commuter (customer). NOT staff.
- Unreliable Opening always — Bangalore traffic moment, commute frustration, identity flex
- Bangalore specificity = strongest hook lever. Name real locations, real pain.
- 2-Layer CTA: video-specific action + "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni" (MANDATORY every video)
- Language: 85% Kannada / 15% English. Tech/lifestyle = English ok. Commuter pain = Kannada.
- 86.9% non-follower reach — hook must convert cold strangers, not just existing fans.
- Shares > Comments > Views. "This is so Bangalore" = highest share trigger for this TG.
- New concepts go ONLY in concepts/10-pending.md. Never create separate files.

## Master Formula Quick-Reference
Hook scores: Absurdist Comedy 8.6 > Cultural Ref 8.4 > Family Emotion 8.3 > PAS 8.0
Story: PAS Comedy Pivot = 81.5% watch-through (best). Twist at 65% mark. Sub-beat every 3-5s.
Share Score: I×E×S — viral at 500+. Feel-Good highest share rate (1.30%).
