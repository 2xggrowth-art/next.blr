# Objective — Why We Create Content

## The One Job
Every concept we create has ONE job: **grab attention and convert it into action.**

Action = buying action first. Everything else (follows, shares, saves, DMs) is a stepping stone toward the viewer walking into BCH and buying.

## Current Phase
10K followers. Magnet content proven. Follower acquisition works.
Now: shift the machine toward **buying-decision content** — content that moves viewers from "I've seen this brand" to "I need to go to this store."

## What "Convert Into Action" Means (Priority Order)
1. **Store visit / test ride booking** — the highest-value action. Content that makes someone drive to BCH.
2. **DM a keyword** — opens a sales conversation. "DM 'PRICE'" = warm lead.
3. **Save the post** — bookmarking = high purchase intent signal. They're coming back.
4. **Share to someone** — "Send this to your friend who's stuck in ORR traffic" = peer referral pipeline.
5. **Follow** — still matters for retargeting, but follower count alone doesn't pay rent.

## The Two Filters for Every Concept
Before approving any concept, it must pass both:

**Filter 1 — Attention:** Will this stop a cold stranger mid-scroll in 1.7 seconds?
- 86.9% of our reach is non-followers. The hook must work on people who have never seen us.
- Pattern interruption is non-negotiable. No slow builds. No greetings. No logos first.

**Filter 2 — Action:** What specific action will the viewer take after watching?
- If the answer is "nothing, they'll just enjoy it" — the concept is incomplete.
- Every concept must have a clear conversion path: watch → feel something → do something.
- The CTA must be baked into the story, not bolted on at the end.

## Content Mix Target
| Type | % of Content | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Buying-decision content | 40-50% | Objection-busting, price anchoring, social proof, test ride triggers |
| Identity/entertainment | 30-35% | "This is so Bangalore" shareability, brand personality, cold audience growth |
| Magnet content | 15-20% | Gated value — follow magnets, DM triggers, save-worthy posts |

## Non-Negotiables
- Bangalore specificity in every concept — real locations, real pain, real language
- 85% Kannada / 15% English — Kannada is the trust language
- Protagonist = young urban commuter (customer), never staff
- 2-layer CTA always: video-specific action + "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni"
- Persistent CTA banner on screen the ENTIRE video
- Every concept must be shootable with current cast, props, and store location (check shoot-resources)
