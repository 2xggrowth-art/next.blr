## SECTION A: ATTENTION LAWS (10 points)
*"Does Frame 1 stop the scroll?"*

| # | Law | Source | Test Question | ✓/✗ |
|---|-----|--------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | **Contrast & Affinity** | Block | Is there strong visual contrast (bright vs dark, big vs small, moving vs still) in frame 1? | |
| 2 | **Movement** | Block | Does something MOVE in the first 0.5 seconds? (body, camera, prop — not text animation) | |
| 3 | **Pattern Interruption** | Cron | Does this visual break what the viewer expects to see while scrolling? Would they think "wait, what?" | |
| 4 | **High-Arousal Emotion** | Berger | Does frame 1 trigger awe, excitement, amusement, anger, OR anxiety? (NOT calm, sad, or neutral) | |
| 5 | **Face + Exaggerated Emotion** | Block | Is a human face with BIG emotion (shock, anger, disbelief, laughter) visible in first 3 seconds? | |
| 6 | **Ambiguous → Reveal** | Block | Can you start with something unidentifiable/confusing then reveal it? (Unreliable Opening) | |
| 7 | **Brightness Law** | Block | Is the subject the BRIGHTEST element in the frame? (On phone, brightness directs the eye) | |
| 8 | **3-Second Comprehension** | Kane | Can a stranger decode the premise in under 3 seconds without any context? | |
| 9 | **Sound-Off Effectiveness** | Kane | Does the hook work fully on MUTE? (text overlay carries the full hook visually) | |
| 10 | **Magazine Cover Test** | Kane | Would frame 1 + text overlay work as a magazine cover at an airport? (5-7 words max) | |

**SECTION A TOTAL: ___/10**

## SECTION B: CURIOSITY LAWS (7 points)
*"Do they NEED to keep watching?"*

| # | Law | Source | Test Question | ✓/✗ |
|---|-----|--------|---------------|-----|
| 11 | **Gap Theory** | Heath | Does the hook highlight something the viewer does NOT know but WANTS to know? | |
| 12 | **Open Loop** | Cron | Is there exactly ONE unanswered question that can only be closed by watching? | |
| 13 | **Dopamine Delay** | Cron | Is the reveal/answer WITHHELD? (Anticipation > answer. Don't frontload the payoff.) | |
| 14 | **Escalation Structure** | Cron | Does it get WORSE before it gets better? (Stack 3-4 problems before the solution) | |
| 15 | **Postdictable Surprise** | Heath | Will the twist make sense in hindsight? ("Of course! I should have seen that coming.") | |
| 16 | **Uncommon Sense** | Heath | Is this the SURPRISING version of a known truth? (Not "traffic is bad" but "his petrol bill dropped from 8000 to 200") | |
| 17 | **Versus Framework** | Cron | Are TWO conflicting realities established? (₹8,000/month vs ₹15/day — show BOTH) | |

**SECTION B TOTAL: ___/7**

## SECTION C: SHAREABILITY LAWS (7 points)
*"Would they DM this to someone?"*

| # | Law | Source | Test Question | ✓/✗ |
|---|-----|--------|---------------|-----|
| 18 | **Narrowcasting Paradox** | Berger | Is this hyper-specific to Bangalore? (Named location, local pain, Kannada phrase) | |
| 19 | **Inner Remarkability** | Berger | Does sharing this make the SHARER look smart/funny/in-the-know? | |
| 20 | **Identity Mirror** | Heath | Does the protagonist represent who the viewer WANTS to be? (Smart, city-savvy, figured it out) | |
| 21 | **Retellability** | Berger | Can someone describe this video in ONE sentence at chai? ("Bro, this guy…") | |
| 22 | **Trigger Frequency** | Berger | Is it linked to something the TG encounters EVERY DAY? (commute, petrol, parking, metro) | |
| 23 | **Multiple STEPPS** | Berger | Does it hit 3+ STEPPS? (Social Currency + Triggers + Emotion + Public + Practical Value + Stories) | |
| 24 | **Physiological Arousal** | Berger | Does the first visual create a PHYSICAL response? (gasp, laugh, cringe, lean-forward) | |

**SECTION C TOTAL: ___/7**

## SECTION D: STORY LAWS (6 points)
*"Does it feel like content, not an ad?"*

| # | Law | Source | Test Question | ✓/✗ |
|---|-----|--------|---------------|-----|
| 25 | **Trojan Horse** | Berger | Is the product hidden INSIDE a story? (Viewer thinks "what happens next?" not "oh, an ad") | |
| 26 | **Valuable Virality** | Berger | Is the story UNTELLABLE without the product? (Swap test: could you replace with any other brand?) | |
| 27 | **Anesthetized Brain** | Cron | Does it look like native content, NOT a commercial? (UGC energy, real location, natural speech) | |
| 28 | **Feel-First-Think-Second** | Cron | Does it lead with EMOTION, not information? (No specs, prices, or features in the hook) | |
| 29 | **Concrete Specificity** | Heath | Does it use specific numbers, real locations, and named situations? (Not abstract benefits) | |
| 30 | **Commander's Intent** | Heath | Is there ONE clear idea that survives even if they only watch 3 seconds? | |

**SECTION D TOTAL: ___/6**

## VERDICT

```
TOTAL SCORE: ___/30

Section A (Attention):  ___/10
Section B (Curiosity):  ___/7
Section C (Shareability): ___/7
Section D (Story):      ___/6
```

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **25-30** | SHOOT IMMEDIATELY | Concept is law-validated. Move to script + shoot. |
| **20-24** | FIX GAPS, THEN SHOOT | Check which laws scored ✗. Fix the weakest section first. |
| **15-19** | REWORK HOOK | The idea may be fine but the hook execution needs redesign. Identify which Section (A/B/C/D) is weakest and rebuild from the failing laws. |
| **Below 15** | KILL CONCEPT | Not enough law-support. Start over with a different idea. |

---

## SECTION WEAKNESS DIAGNOSTICS

| Weakest Section | Problem | Fix |
|-----------------|---------|-----|
| **A (Attention)** below 6 | Frame 1 won't stop the scroll | Redesign the visual: add movement, increase contrast, add face with emotion, make it work on mute |
| **B (Curiosity)** below 4 | They'll stop but won't stay | Add an information gap, delay the reveal, build escalation ("it gets worse"), add a versus |
| **C (Shareability)** below 4 | They'll watch but won't share | Make it more Bangalore-specific, connect to daily trigger, make protagonist aspirational, compress to 1-sentence retellability |
| **D (Story)** below 3 | It feels like an ad | Hide the product deeper in the story, lead with emotion, add specific details, ensure ONE clear idea |
