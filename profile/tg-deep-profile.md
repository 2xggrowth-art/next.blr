## TG Segment 1: THE BANGALORE URBAN COMMUTER (primary — 50%)

### Who They Are
- Age 24-38, professional working in Bangalore's tech/startup/creative economy
- Commute: 5-15km one way (Indiranagar to Whitefield, Koramangala to MG Road, etc.)
- Currently: petrol bike / Uber / Metro + last-mile struggle
- Self-image: progressive, environmentally aware, health-conscious — "I should cycle"
- Has thought about cycling to work but never pulled the trigger
- The blocker isn't price — it's friction (where to park? what if it rains? safe roads?)

### Daily Routine
<!-- FILL THIS — Map the exact Bangalore commuter day -->
- 7:00 AM: Wake up, check traffic (Google Maps, NextBillion Maps)
- 8:00 AM: Commute struggle (traffic / wait for cab?)
- 9:30 AM: Office (usually 30-45 min late because of traffic)
- 6:30 PM: Evening commute repeat
- 8:00 PM: Home — frustrated
- Weekend:
<!-- Add more detail from real conversations -->

### Pain Points (Bangalore-specific)
1. Traffic on ORR/Silk Board/Marathahalli — adds 30-60 min to every commute
2. Petrol cost: Rs. 150-200/day x 22 working days = Rs. 3,300-4,400/month
3. Parking: Rs. 50-150/day in office areas
4. Cab surge pricing during rain (the worst timing)
5. "I've been meaning to cycle to work but haven't started"
6. <!-- ADD MORE from Bangalore-specific conversations -->

### What Makes Them Finally Switch to Cycling
- A trigger calculation: "Wait, I'm spending Rs. 5,000/month on commute??"
- Seeing someone exactly like them cycling to work successfully
- A Bangalore-specific route that makes it feel possible
- A friend starts cycling and reports actual numbers
- <!-- ADD MORE -->

### Objections (Bangalore commuter specific)
<!-- FILL THIS -->
1. "Bangalore roads mein cycle? Pothole bahut hai yaar" (Too many potholes)
2. "Rain mein kya kare?" (What about rain season?)
3. "Office parking for cycle hai kya?" (Does office have cycle parking?)
4. "Sweat ho jayega — office mein kaise aau?" (I'll sweat — how to arrive at office?)
5. <!-- ADD MORE -->

### Language & Culture
<!-- FILL THIS — This is critical for authentic Next.BLR content voice -->
- Kannada-English mix? (Probably more English-dominant than BCH Main's audience)
- What do they call themselves? "Bangalorean" vs "Bangalore person" vs "Blr-ite"?
- What Instagram accounts represent their aesthetic? (Minimal? Vibrant Bangalore life?)
- What food they eat (chai-coffee culture? craft beer? startup canteen?)
- What Bangalore landmarks they reference daily?
- What do they argue about? (Metro route? Namma Yatri? BMTC?)

### What Makes Them SHARE Next.BLR Content
- "Yaar, exactly how I feel about Bangalore traffic" — resonance
- A calculation/comparison they want to forward to their carpool group
- Something that says "Bangalore people get it" — insider content
- <!-- ADD MORE -->

## TG Segment 2: THE LIFESTYLE / FITNESS RIDER (secondary — 30%)

### Who They Are
<!-- FILL THIS -->

- Age 26-35, disposable income, Bangalore's fitness culture crowd
- Wants to cycle Cubbon Park, Nandi Hills weekends, Hesaraghatta
- What's their current fitness routine? Why cycle as an addition?

### Pain Points
<!-- FILL THIS -->
- Current gym routine getting boring?
- Friends cycling together — fear of missing out?
- Specific route they dream of cycling?
- What stops them from starting?

## TG Segment 3: THE "BANGALORE IS MY BRAND" PERSON (20%)

### Who They Are
<!-- FILL THIS -->
- Deep Bangalore identity — moved here from another city or grew up here, either way: BANGALORE IS HOME
- Namma Bengaluru energy — proud of the city, engages with Bangalore content
- This person shares Bangalore-specific content regularly
