## What Is a Pattern Interruption Hook?

The **first 2-3 seconds** of a video. Its ONLY job: **stop a random stranger from scrolling.**

It opens a **MENTAL LOOP** — "What is happening?" — that can ONLY close by watching till the end.

```
Hook OPENS a mental loop → Body sustains the loop → End CLOSES the loop
```

If the viewer can figure out the entire concept from the first 3 seconds, there's no loop, and they'll scroll away.

---

## The 3-Section Structure (Every Concept)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SECTION 1: PATTERN INTERRUPTION VISUAL HOOK │
│ (First 2-3 seconds)                         │
│ Opens a MENTAL LOOP — "What is happening?"  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SECTION 2: BODY (Seamless from hook)        │
│ Hook flows into body — ONE piece, not two   │
│ New VALUE every 3-5 seconds                 │
│ PROMOTING: [one clear product/service/offer]│
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SECTION 3: CTA (Natural from body)          │
│ Story leads naturally to call to action     │
│ Same CTA across entire series               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Trinity Rule:**
- Strong hook + weak body = content dies (viewer gets hooked then drops)
- Strong body + weak hook = nobody sees the body (great value, zero eyeballs)
- Hook + body without CTA = missed opportunity (no behavioral trigger)

The human brain remembers the **FIRST part and the LAST part.** Middle gets compressed. So:
- First 3 sec (hook) = must STOP the scroll
- Last 3-5 sec (CTA) = must PLANT the brand association
- Body in between = must deliver VALUE every 3-5 sec to prevent drop-off

---

## The 4 Hook Layers

**Design ALL 4 for every concept. All 4 must deliver the SAME message.**

| Layer | What It Is | Rule | Example (Burning Cycle, scored 9.0) |
|-------|-----------|------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Visual** | Physical action that stops the scroll | Must be dramatic, visceral, physical — NOT a phone screen, text chat, or subtle expression | Man LITERALLY sets old cycle on FIRE |
| **2. Text** | On-screen overlay creating curiosity | Appears by 0:02. 1-3 lines max. High-contrast color. | "King of Cycles / Exchange Offer" |
| **3. Spoken** | Bold opening line in Kannada | Fires simultaneously with visual, not after. Max 2-3 sentences. | "Old cycle iddre fire hakbidi!" |
| **4. SFX** | Sound/editing punch that amplifies | Must amplify the visual, not compete with it | Fire crackling + dramatic bass drop |

**Critical Rule:** If visual says "fire," text says "exchange offer," and spoken says "come to our store" — the hook is MISALIGNED and will underperform. All 4 layers must point to the same message.

**Most creators only design the visual — this is why most content underperforms.**

---

## What a Visual Hook Actually IS vs. IS NOT

**What it IS:**
- Breaking, fire, throwing, destruction, shocking gesture
- Happens in 1-4 seconds
- Visceral — makes you FEEL something (shock, danger, curiosity)
- Props are simple but the ACTION is extreme
- RAW PHYSICAL ENERGY

**What it is NOT:**
- Clever wordplay
- Split screens or slow reveals
- Phone screens or text chats
- Subtle emotions or facial expressions
- A person standing and talking

**The body does something dramatic before the mouth says anything.**

---

## The "Concept IS the Hook" Principle

The strongest concepts don't need a separate "visual hook" bolted on. **The IDEA itself is the hook.**

- **Weak:** [Random dramatic action] + [Story about product] = Two disconnected pieces
- **Strong:** [Absurd situation that IS the concept] = One seamless piece

**Test:** Can you describe the concept in one sentence that makes someone laugh? If describing it doesn't make someone laugh, it's not a concept — it's just a story with a hook taped to it.

## Hook Type Taxonomy (Ranked by Avg Score)

| Hook Type | Avg Score | When To Use | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Absurdist Comedy** | 8.6 | Universal pain point → exaggerate to absurd | V80: Man drinks petrol |
| **Cultural Reference** | 8.4 | Product visually matches beloved icon | V11: Rocky Bhai's e-bike |
| **Family Emotion** | 8.3 | Kid/parent content, achievement, guilt | V21: Child's 5-year savings |
| **PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution)** | 8.0 | Daily problem → dramatize → reveal solution | V80: Petrol pain → e-cycle |
| **Price Shock** | 7.8 | Price so low it triggers disbelief | V32: Rs.999 EMI reveal |
| **Cash/Money Visual** | 7.8 | Physical money in frame activates greed | V35: Money pickup from street |
| **CCTV/Surveillance** | 7.8 | "Caught in the wild" authenticity format | V61: Store CCTV footage |
| **Controversy + Proof** | 7.6 | Open with hate → defend with specs | V27: "People HATE this e-bike" |
| **Before/After Narrative** | 7.4 | Transformation visible in same video | V18: Delivery worker → BCH staff |
| **Testimonial** | 7.1 | Real customer speaks, unscripted | V2: Mother's 5-year savings story |
| **Feature Demo** | 6.9 | Lowest-performing. Use only with strong hook. | V78: Man lists accessories |

---

## Hook Type Decision Tree

```
Does the concept have an EMOTIONAL STORY (kid, family, transformation)?
├─ YES → Use NARRATIVE HOOK (lead with emotion, delay product to 0:15+)
│
├─ NO → Does the product have a PRICE/OFFER that shocks?
│  ├─ YES → Use PRICE-SHOCK HOOK (price in first frame, proof within 10 sec)
│  │
│  └─ NO → Is there a CULTURAL ICON that matches the product?
│     ├─ YES → Use CULTURAL-REFERENCE HOOK (icon name + product visual match)
│     │
│     └─ NO → Is there a DAILY PROBLEM the audience experiences?
│        ├─ YES → Use PAS HOOK (dramatize problem to absurdity → reveal solution)
│        │
│        └─ NO → Does the product have a VISUAL WOW feature?
│           ├─ YES → Use DISCOVERY HOOK (wow feature within first 7 seconds)
│           └─ NO → Use CONTROVERSY HOOK (hate comments + defense)
```

## Unreliable Opening Techniques

Every video scoring 8+ uses one of these:

| Type | Technique | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Genre Misdirection** | Hook looks like one content type, reveals as another | V80: Looks like comedy skit → actually cycle shop |
| **Expectation Reversal** | Opens suggesting one outcome, delivers opposite | V2: Mother drags kid by ear → actually giving a gift |
| **Numerical Misdirection** | Price/number misleads initially | V26: Rs.999 sounds like outright price → is monthly EMI |
| **Skeptic Character** | Opens with doubt/skepticism, character converts | V17: "Is this electrical?" → convinced by features |
| **Visual Contradiction** | What you see contradicts what you hear/expect | V80: Man drinking petrol = absurd visual, real pain point |

**For Next.BLR:** Unreliable Opening always — Bangalore traffic moment, commute frustration, identity flex.

---

## The 12-Point Hook Scoring Framework

**Score EVERY concept on these 12 dimensions BEFORE shooting. Minimum composite: 7.5/10.**

| # | Dimension | What It Measures | Score 8+ Looks Like | Score Below 6 |
|---|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Involuntary Attention Capture** | Does frame 1 stop scrolling automatically? | Fire, money, danger, faces, anomaly, destruction | Man standing next to bike |
| 2 | **Cognitive Disruption** | Does the visual violate expectations? | Funeral for a cycle, drinking petrol, CCTV of a kid buying | Standard showroom demo |
| 3 | **Curiosity Gap** | Is there an unanswered question? | "Why is he burning a cycle?" "Why did he faint?" | No question — viewer knows what happens next |
| 4 | **Emotional Micro-Trigger** | Does it fire an emotion in <1 second? | Shock, greed, parent guilt, laughter, pride | Purely informational, no feeling |
| 5 | **Platform-Native Twist** | Does it feel like a Reel, not a YouTube ad? | Street Kannada, handheld, UGC energy, trending format | Studio-shot, corporate, landscape video |
| 6 | **Sound-Off Effectiveness** | Does it work fully on mute? | Text overlay carries full hook; visual tells story alone | 100% audio-dependent; mute = meaningless |
| 7 | **Relevance Bridge** | How fast does viewer connect hook to product? | By 0:07 maximum | Product appears only at 0:20+ with no bridge |
| 8 | **Motion/Kinetics** | Is there visual movement in first 3 sec? | 3+ distinct motions, gimbal, cuts, body movement | Static tripod, no zoom, person standing still |
| 9 | **Contrast/Color** | Does the visual pop against a feed? | High-contrast text, bright clothing, product color pop | Dull, low-contrast, blends into feed |
| 10 | **Repetition Resilience** | Does it stay engaging on rewatch? | Emotional depth, new details on repeat | One-time gag, novelty gone after first view |
| 11 | **Thumbnail-Hook Alignment** | Does thumbnail = first frame? | Exact match, zero bait-and-switch | Different thumbnail, viewer clicks and leaves |
| 12 | **Shareability Signal** | Does the hook trigger sharing urge? | "I NEED to send this to someone" within 3 sec | Nothing worth forwarding |

**Composite Score → Expected Performance:**
- **8.5+:** 70%+ watch-past-3s, 1.5%+ share rate, 2M+ views potential
- **7.5-8.4:** 55-70% watch-past-3s, 0.8-1.5% share rate
- **6.5-7.4:** 45-55% watch-past-3s, needs paid distribution
- **Below 6.5:** Don't shoot. Rework.

---

## Quick Hook Score (0-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 9-10 | Instant scroll-stop. Physical action + mental loop + TG-specific. Produce immediately. |
| 7-8 | Strong. Needs minor tuning. Produceable. |
| 5-6 | Decent concept but hook is weak. Don't produce until hook is upgraded. |
| 3-4 | Concept might be OK but hook fails completely. Redo. |
| 1-2 | Nothing pattern-interrupting. Kill it. |

**If below 8, reject and redo.**

---

## The 10 Failure Diagnostics

**Run every concept through these 10 checks. Failing 4+ = rework.**

| # | Failure Mode | Test Question | Pass/Fail Threshold |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **No Pattern Interrupt** | Would this first frame make you stop scrolling? | If it looks like "man next to bike" → FAIL |
| 2 | **Confusion** | Can viewer decode premise in 2 seconds? | If they need 5+ seconds to understand → FAIL |
| 3 | **Slow Build** | Does payoff arrive by 0:05? | If hook takes 5+ seconds to fire → FAIL |
| 4 | **Audio Dependency** | Does it work on mute? | If mute = meaningless → FAIL |
| 5 | **Weak Thumbnail** | Does thumbnail match first frame? | If different → FAIL |
| 6 | **Wrong Audience** | Will the FIRST frame attract your TG specifically? | If it attracts random viewers → FAIL |
| 7 | **Clickbait** | Does the video deliver what the hook promises? | If promise ≠ delivery → FAIL |
| 8 | **Over-Promise** | Will the claim trigger "too good to be true" skepticism? | If no proof within 10 sec → FAIL |
| 9 | **No Emotion** | Is there an emotional spike in first 3 sec? | If purely informational → FAIL |
| 10 | **Flat Camera** | Is there movement/cuts in first 3 sec? | If static tripod, no motion → FAIL |

## The MVP Formula (Proven Conversion Reel Flow)

```
SECOND 0-3:   BOLD STATEMENT / PATTERN INTERRUPT
SECOND 3-8:   USE CASE (how does this fit into the viewer's life?)
SECOND 8-15:  PRICE (specific number, specific comparison)
SECOND 15-22: VALUE STACK (free extras, benefits, social proof)
SECOND 22-30: STRONG CTA (clear, single action)
```

**Why it works:** New VALUE every 3-5 seconds. Not entertainment — INFORMATION. The viewer LEARNS something new every few seconds.

---

## Script Template Format

```
## [SERIES-NUMBER] — [CONCEPT NAME]
**Hook Score:** [X]/10
**TG:** [Specific person this targets]
**Emotion:** [High-arousal emotion triggered]
**Promoting:** [Exactly what product/service/offer this sells]

### Section 1: Pattern Interruption Visual Hook (0-3 sec)
**Visual:** [What the viewer SEES — physical, dramatic]
**Spoken:** [What they HEAR — bold opening line]
**Text:** [On-screen text overlay]
**SFX:** [Sound effect or editing punch]

[Description of the first 2-3 seconds in casual language]

### Section 2: Body (3-20 sec)
[How the hook flows seamlessly into the story/value]
[Value drop every 3-5 seconds — label each beat]
**PROMOTING:** [One clear line about what we're selling]

### Section 3: CTA (Last 3-5 sec)
[How the story leads naturally to the call to action]
**CTA:** [Signature phrase + behavioral trigger + location + deadline + DM keyword]

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** [Who specifically would DM this? What would they say?]
- **Chai:** [How would someone describe this in conversation?]
- **Tuesday:** [What daily trigger would recall this content?]
- **TG Filter:** [Would only the TG care, or would random viewers also engage?]
```

## Next.BLR Specific Hook Rules

- **Unreliable Opening always** — Bangalore traffic moment, commute frustration, identity flex
- **Bangalore specificity = strongest hook lever.** Name real locations, real pain.
- **Protagonist = young urban commuter (customer).** NOT staff.
- **Language:** 85% Kannada / 15% English. Tech/lifestyle = English ok. Commuter pain = Kannada.
- **86.9% non-follower reach** — hook must convert cold strangers, not just existing fans.
- **Shares > Comments > Views.** "This is so Bangalore" = highest share trigger for this TG.
- **Bangalore specificity examples for hooks:** ORR traffic, Koramangala parking, petrol bills, metro gaps, Silk Board junction, HSR Layout one-ways.

## The 10 Non-Negotiable Videographer Checkpoints (2026 Algorithm-Aligned)

> Hand this to the videographer. If all 10 pass → the visual hook is covered.
> These 10 checkpoints cover 80% of what makes or breaks the hook BEFORE it reaches the editor.
>
> **2026 Algorithm Hierarchy (Mosseri-confirmed):**
> 1. **Watch Time** — completion rate, replays, 3-second hold (MOST IMPORTANT)
> 2. **Sends Per Reach** — DM shares carry 3-5x more weight than likes for non-follower reach
> 3. **Likes Per Reach** — ratio matters, not raw count
>
> Every checkpoint below directly feeds one or more of these three signals.
> Updated February 2026 from algorithm data + platform documentation.

---

### CP-1: THE 0.5-SECOND FRAME TEST
> Viewers decide in 1.7 seconds. 50% drop off by second 3. You have HALF A SECOND.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (3-second hold rate)**
Instagram measures whether viewers watch past 3 seconds. This single metric determines if your Reel gets tested with a wider audience or dies in the small test pool. 50% of viewers are gone by second 3 — your Frame 1 is the gatekeeper.

- Frame 1 = the thumbnail. Instagram does NOT let you pick a separate thumbnail for Reels in feed. What you shoot as the opening frame IS the thumbnail.
- Shoot the opening so Frame 1 already has tension — mid-action, mid-fall, fire visible, money in hand, face mid-expression. NOT a smile. NOT a standing person. NOT an empty frame.
- The algorithm flags "slow hooks" — if there's no visual change in the first 0.5 seconds, the Reel gets deprioritized before it even reaches humans.

**Do this on set:** Record the take. Immediately pause at Frame 1 on your phone. Screenshot it. *Would this single image make YOU stop if you saw it between a cat video and a meme?* If no → reshoot before moving on.

---

### CP-2: VISUAL CHANGE WITHIN 1.5 SECONDS
> The algorithm needs to detect motion/change in the first 1.5 seconds or it deprioritizes the Reel.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (early swipe-away prevention)**
Instagram's distribution system evaluates "early swipe-through behavior." A visual change — camera movement, subject action, prop in motion — within the first 1.5 seconds signals to the algorithm that this content has enough energy to test further. Static openings trigger deprioritization.

- Camera moving OR subject moving OR prop moving — minimum ONE must be in motion by Frame 1. All three = score 8+ hook.
- "The body does something dramatic before the mouth says anything." Motion BEFORE dialogue. Always.
- 3+ distinct motions in first 3 seconds = top-performing hook territory.
- Static tripod + person talking = the #1 killer of Reels. This isn't a Zoom call.

**Do this on set:** Call "action" → count to two. If nothing has visually changed — no camera move, no body action, no prop — *cut immediately and redo.* Don't even finish the take.

---

### CP-3: FACE + EXAGGERATED EMOTION IN FIRST 3 SECONDS
> Face in frame increases retention by 35%. The algorithm literally measures this.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (retention boost)**
Data shows face-in-first-frame Reels hold 35% more viewers past the 3-second mark. The human brain has dedicated neural wiring for face detection — it fires involuntarily. The algorithm tracks this retention bump and rewards it with wider distribution.

- The face must show a BIG emotion — shock, anger, disbelief, laughter, pain. Subtle expressions don't read on a 6-inch phone screen being scrolled at speed.
- Protagonist's face (young urban commuter), NOT staff, NOT the product. Product comes AFTER the face hooks them.
- Close enough to READ the expression. If the face is a tiny dot in a wide shot, the brain doesn't register it as a face → no retention bump.
- Direct the talent with SPECIFIC emotional prompts, not "look surprised."

**Do this on set:** Give the talent a real scenario: *"React like your Rapido driver just cancelled at Silk Board during rain."* Film the GENUINE reaction, not a posed one. If the expression doesn't make YOU react watching it back → do another take with a more extreme prompt.

---

### CP-4: SHOOT EVERY SCENE IN 1.8-SECOND SHOTS
> Top-performing Reels average 1.8 seconds per shot. Static shots >4 seconds = viewer exits.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (retention curve / no flat spots)**
The algorithm analyzes your retention curve — a moment-by-moment map of audience drop-off. Every time there's a static shot longer than 4 seconds, the curve dips (viewers leave). The algorithm sees dips = weak content = less distribution. Top Reels maintain energy with cuts or visual changes every 1.5-3 seconds.

- Plan your shoot so every scene gives the editor a CUT POINT every 2-3 seconds maximum.
- Shoot each action from 2-3 ANGLES (close-up, medium, wide). This isn't extra work — it's giving the editor the raw material to maintain 1.8-sec pacing.
- Never hold a static shot longer than 3 seconds. If the action takes longer, MOVE THE CAMERA during it.
- For a 20-second Reel: plan for minimum 10-12 distinct shots/angles.

**Do this on set:** For every scene in the script, shoot it from at least 2 angles. *Mark on the shot list: "CU + WIDE" for every beat.* If you only shot one angle for a scene → you've failed the editor.

---

### CP-5: TIGHT → WIDE SIZE JUMP (THE FREE PATTERN INTERRUPT)
> The brain takes 1-2 seconds to re-orient after a drastic framing change. That's free watch time.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (cognitive engagement = longer viewing)**
A jump from Extreme Close-Up → Wide Shot forces the brain to recalibrate what it's looking at. During that recalibration, the viewer CAN'T scroll — they're processing. That's 1-2 seconds of free watch time the algorithm counts.

- Open on ECU (hands, eyes, texture, product detail, ₹ note, petrol receipt) → cut to Medium or Wide for context reveal.
- The bigger the size jump, the stronger the interrupt. ECU of sweating forehead → wide shot of Silk Board gridlock. ECU of ₹999 price sticker → wide shot of full e-cycle.
- This requires shooting TWO separate setups for every hook: the tight shot AND the wide reveal.

**Do this on set:** For every hook, set up the ECU shot FIRST (it's the most important frame). Then move to the wide shot. *Label them clearly for the editor: "HOOK-TIGHT-01" and "HOOK-WIDE-01."* Never leave set without both.

---

### CP-6: FILM THE LOOP (LAST FRAME → FIRST FRAME)
> Seamless loops trick viewers into rewatching. Rewatches = watch time > video length = massive algorithm boost.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (rewatches / completion rate >100%)**
This is the biggest 2026 unlock. When a Reel loops seamlessly, the average viewer watches 1.5-2x the video length without realizing they've rewatched. The algorithm sees watch time EXCEEDING video duration and treats it as an extremely strong quality signal, pushing the Reel to exponentially wider audiences. A looping 15-second Reel with 110% average watch time outperforms a 30-second Reel with 70% completion.

- Film the LAST action of the video so it visually connects to the FIRST frame. Same position, same angle, same lighting.
- The ending shouldn't feel like an ending — no fade, no wave, no "bye." It should feel like the video is still going.
- Best loop technique: end on the same LOCATION or CAMERA ANGLE as the opening. The viewer's eye doesn't catch the restart.
- Plan the loop BEFORE shooting. Tell the talent: "We start and end in the same spot, same energy."

**Do this on set:** Before shooting, plan the loop: *"Frame 1 is [X]. Last frame must match [X]."* Shoot the opening and the closing BACK TO BACK so lighting/position match exactly. Review the loop on phone — if you can spot where it restarts → reshoot the ending.

---

### CP-7: CLEAN AUDIO ON SET (80%+ WATCH WITH SOUND ON)
> 2026 update: 80%+ of Reels are now watched WITH sound. Audio quality directly affects retention.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time (audio-visual sync = fewer swipe-aways)**
The old "most people watch muted" rule has flipped. In 2026, 80%+ of Reel viewers have sound on. Poor audio — wind noise, echo, muffled dialogue, traffic drowning out speech — causes immediate swipe-aways. The algorithm also detects audio-visual sync; mismatched cuts-to-audio-rhythm feel "off" and viewers leave without knowing why.

- Use a lav mic or shotgun mic within 2 feet of talent. Phone mic from 5 feet away = amateur sound = swipe.
- Record a 10-second "room tone" at every location. The editor needs this to fill gaps cleanly.
- Avoid locations with heavy ambient noise (traffic roar, crowd chatter, construction). If you MUST shoot there, get the mic CLOSER.
- Do a test recording at every new location. Play it back with earphones. If the dialogue isn't crystal clear → move or mic closer.
- Clap or snap at the start of each take for audio-visual sync point in editing.

**Do this on set:** Before the first real take at any location, *record 10 seconds of silence (room tone) + do one test take. Play back with earphones.* If you can't hear every word clearly → fix mic placement before shooting anything else.

---

### CP-8: CONTRAST + COLOR THAT BREAKS THE FEED
> The algorithm uses visual quality signals. High-contrast, well-lit frames = higher quality score = more distribution.

**Algorithm signal: Watch Time + Originality Score (visual quality detection)**
Instagram's 2026 algorithm evaluates visual quality through computer vision. High-contrast frames, good lighting, and color-popped subjects signal "professionally created original content" to the system. This feeds both the quality score (more distribution) and the originality score (original creators got 40-60% reach increases in 2026). Dull, low-contrast, poorly-lit footage signals low effort.

- Your frame must CLASH with the grey-brown scroll. Bright clothing against Bangalore's grey streets. Mint/teal product POPPING against concrete. White text with black stroke by 0:02.
- Use directional light: one side bright, other side shadow = instant cinema. Costs nothing — just position the talent relative to the sun or a window.
- Backlight silhouette → subject steps into light = zero-cost dramatic reveal.
- The product's mint/teal color is your visual weapon. Make sure it's visible and LIT in the frame.

**Do this on set:** Before shooting, *open Instagram, scroll for 10 seconds, then look at your camera monitor.* Does your frame look DIFFERENT from the grey feed? If it blends in → change the talent's clothing color, reposition for better light, or add a practical light source.

---

### CP-9: SHOOT FOR THE SHARE ("WHO WOULD I DM THIS TO?")
> DM sends carry 3-5x more weight than likes for reaching non-followers. Next.BLR is 86.9% non-follower reach. Sends ARE the growth engine.

**Algorithm signal: Sends Per Reach (the #1 signal for non-follower distribution)**
Mosseri confirmed: DM shares are the STRONGEST signal for expanding reach beyond your followers. 694,000 Reels are sent via DM every minute. For Next.BLR (86.9% non-follower reach), this is THE metric that matters. People share content that's relatable, identity-affirming, or practically useful. "This is SO Bangalore" = the highest share trigger for your TG.

- While filming, ask: *"Would a 25-year-old Bangalore techie DM this to their work group?"* If no → the concept or execution isn't shareable enough.
- Film Bangalore-specific RECOGNIZABLE moments — ORR traffic, Koramangala parking chaos, Silk Board junction, auto fare shock. The more specific to Bangalore, the more "I NEED to send this to my friend" energy.
- Shoot REACTION-WORTHY moments: the talent's genuine shock, laughter, or frustration. People share emotions, not information.
- Include at least one "screenshot-worthy" frame — a moment so visual that people would screenshot and share on their story.

**Do this on set:** After filming a take, show it to someone on set (crew, passerby, anyone). Ask them one question: *"Who would you send this to?"* If they can NAME a specific person → you have a share-worthy Reel. If they say "I don't know" → the take lacks shareability. Rethink the execution.

---

### CP-10: THE TECHNICAL NON-NEGOTIABLES (ALGORITHM PENALTIES)
> Getting these wrong doesn't just lower quality — the algorithm ACTIVELY PENALIZES you. Zero-tolerance items.

**Algorithm signal: Originality Score + Quality Score (technical gatekeeping)**
Instagram's 2026 algorithm uses visual fingerprinting and quality detection. Violating these specs triggers AUTOMATIC reach suppression — your Reel gets tested with fewer people or removed from Explore entirely. Accounts posting watermarked content saw 60-80% reach drops. These aren't suggestions. They're gates.

**Resolution & Format:**
- Shoot at 1080x1920 minimum (9:16 vertical). NEVER shoot horizontal and crop later — Instagram detects this.
- 30fps. Not 24fps (looks choppy on mobile), not 60fps (compression issues on Instagram). 30fps.
- HDR OFF on your camera. HDR causes color inconsistency after Instagram's compression.
- Export: MP4, H.264 codec, 8000kbps bitrate, AAC audio at 48kHz/256kbps.

**Watermark Death Sentence:**
- ZERO watermarks from TikTok, CapCut, or any third-party app. The algorithm flags and suppresses these.
- Remove any editor logos or "made with" bugs before export.

**Upload Protocol:**
- Enable "Upload at highest quality" in Instagram settings.
- Upload from PHONE (Instagram's mobile compression is better than desktop).
- Preview the uploaded Reel on a DIFFERENT phone before publishing. If it looks blurry or compressed → re-export at higher bitrate and re-upload.

**Do this on set:** Before the shoot starts, check camera settings: *1080x1920, 30fps, HDR OFF.* These three settings take 10 seconds to verify and prevent the algorithm from killing your Reel before a single human sees it.
