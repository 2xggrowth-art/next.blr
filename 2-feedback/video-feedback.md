### NB-M1 — "10 Gifts Only For Followers" (Magnet Content)
- **Date Published:** ~Feb 2026
- **Series:** MAGNET (Next.BLR)
- **Content Type:** Altruistic Gate — Magnet Content (follower acquisition)
- **Duration:** ~42 seconds
- **Follower Impact:** Contributed to growth from 734 → 10,000 followers
- **Views (24h):** <!-- FILL -->
- **Views (7d):** <!-- FILL -->
- **Shares:** <!-- FILL -->
- **Comments (notable):** <!-- FILL -->
- **Watch-through %:** Estimated 70-80% (based on escalation mechanics)
- **Hook Score:** ~7.6-7.9 (VHS calculation from breakdown)
- **What worked:**
  - **Explicit Gate:** "10 GIFT ONLY FOR FOLLOWERS" on screen at 0:00 — converted strangers to followers
  - **Escalation Ladder:** Items stacked sequentially (Smart Light → Helmet → Pump → Jersey → Massage Gun → Smart Glasses) — each item violated expectations, preventing drop-off
  - **Proxy Protagonist:** Kid asking for "helicopter" = adorable anomaly. Low-stakes protester lowers viewer defensiveness. Viewer gets vicarious wish-fulfillment
  - **Prediction Error:** Viewer expected cheap gifts or "no." Got premium gear (Cult Massage Gun, Smart Glasses) = retention spike
  - **Social Contract:** "Only for followers" reframed follow from passive action to membership qualification
  - **Physical Proof:** Gifts physically stacked on kid's arms, worn/demonstrated on camera = tangible, not hypothetical
  - **High Energy + Kannada Banter:** Fast-paced, playful, combative dialogue. Platform-native feel.
  - **Narrative Gap:** "Helicopter" reference kept viewers till the end
- **What didn't:**
  - <!-- FILL — any notable drop-off points or negative comments? -->
- **Repeat this:**
  - Escalation stacking (sequential item reveal, NOT all at once)
  - Explicit follower gate in text overlay at 0:00
  - Kid as proxy protagonist
  - Physical handover of items (touch, wear, demonstrate)
  - 3-5 sec per item beat pacing
- **Avoid this:**
  - Don't overuse this exact format — magnet content works because it's the exception, not the rule. 1 per 3-4 regular posts max.
- **Formula (validated):** `V = VHS × (Retention_Gradient × Prediction_Error) + Status_Signal`
- **Content Category Added:** MAGNET — first proven magnet content for Next.BLR
