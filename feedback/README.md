# Feedback Folder

This folder stores all feedback on concepts, scripts, and published videos. Feedback is used as fuel for generating better concepts.

## How to Use
1. After every shoot/publish, log feedback in `video-feedback.md`
2. After concept reviews (Syed Bhai / team), log in `concept-feedback.md`
3. Audience reactions and comments go in `audience-feedback.md`
4. Before generating new concepts, Claude reads this folder for patterns

## Files
- `video-feedback.md` — Post-publish performance + learnings
- `concept-feedback.md` — Review notes on concepts (approved/rejected reasons)
- `audience-feedback.md` — DM reactions, comments, shares patterns

## Feedback → Concept Loop
When generating new concepts, feedback files are read to:
- Repeat what worked (hooks, formats, situations)
- Avoid what flopped (patterns, tones, setups)
- Double down on audience triggers that got real engagement
