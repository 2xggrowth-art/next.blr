> **Purpose:** Raw ideas generated from the objective. Every idea here is a seed — it becomes a full NB concept only after it passes through the engine + validation.

## How Ideas Work

1. Ideas are generated from the **objective** (`1-profile/objective.md`)
2. Each idea maps to a content type: **Buying-Decision (40-50%)** | **Identity-Entertainment (30-35%)** | **Magnet (15-20%)**
3. Ideas are one-liners — not full scripts. The engine turns them into scripts.
4. Track the content mix to ensure we're covering the objective's ratio.

## IDEAS

### Buying-Decision Ideas
_Content that moves viewers from "I've seen this brand" to "I need to go to this store."_

| # | Idea | Product | Score | Verdict |
|---|------|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Guy slams ₹4,200 petrol receipt on table. Then slams ₹350 electricity bill next to it. Same commute. Same distance. Stares at camera. "Choose." | Street Mamba (105km) | 25/30 | SHOOT |
| 2 | Bodycam POV: cyclist weaving past ORR traffic at 25 km/h. Cars next to him: 8 km/h. Text: "The fastest vehicle on ORR isn't what you think." Reveal: it's an e-cycle. | Any AOKI | 27/30 | SHOOT |
| 3 | Random stranger bets ₹500 the Flex GO won't fold small enough to fit in an auto rickshaw. Guy folds it in 10 seconds. Puts it in the auto. Stranger's jaw drops. He owes ₹500. | Flex GO | 26/30 | SHOOT |
| 4 | Fake CCTV angle of office entrance. Time-stamp overlay. 9:47 AM — scooter guy, sweating, cursing parking. 9:52 AM — cab guy, frustrated, surge receipt in hand. 8:55 AM — e-cyclist parks, walks in fresh, coffee in hand. "Same 8 km. One arrives 50 minutes early." | Any AOKI | 26/30 | SHOOT |
| 5 | Split screen race: Person A exits Namma Metro, waits for auto (driver says no, negotiates fare, 12 min wasted). Person B exits same metro, unfolds Flex GO in 10 seconds, rides away. Person A still negotiating. Person B already at office. | Flex GO | 27/30 | SHOOT |

### Identity-Entertainment Ideas
_"This is so Bangalore" shareability, brand personality, cold audience growth._

| # | Idea | Product | Score | Verdict |
|---|------|---------|-------|---------|
| 6 | Types of Bangalore commuters as characters: The ORR Zombie (scooter, dead eyes), The Uber Calculator (checking surge), The Metro Sardine (packed train), The Parking Warrior (circling for spots) — then the e-cyclist glides past all of them, sunglasses on, coffee in hand. "Choose your character." | General | 25/30 | SHOOT |
| 7 | Split screen: Uber taking "fastest route" through 47 min of traffic vs. e-cycle cutting through lanes. Same starting point, same destination. E-cyclist arrives, orders chai at a tapri, waits. Uber finally shows up. "Bro, traffic." | Any AOKI | 25/30 | SHOOT |
| 8 | Guy explaining Bangalore commute to a non-Bangalorean on phone: "I leave at 7:30 for 9 AM office... no, it's only 8 km... yes, 90 minutes... no, I'm not walking..." Friend's face getting more confused with each answer. Cut to: him on e-cycle. "25 minutes. Explained." | Any AOKI | 25/30 | SHOOT |

### Magnet Ideas
_Gated value — follow magnets, DM triggers, save-worthy posts._

| # | Idea | Product | Score | Verdict |
|---|------|---------|-------|---------|
| 9 | Film 3 real Bangalore commutes on e-cycle: Koramangala→Whitefield (time + cost), HSR→Electronic City (time + cost), Indiranagar→MG Road (time + cost). Split screen with car/auto time for each. "Your route missing? DM 'ROUTE' — we'll map yours." | Any AOKI | 25/30 | SHOOT |
| 10 | "This Bangalore cycling lane skips Silk Board entirely." POV footage of one secret shortcut. Google Maps comparison: car through Silk Board = 47 min, this route = 14 min on e-cycle. "4 more routes like this. DM 'MAP' or follow for the series." | Any AOKI | 27/30 | SHOOT |
