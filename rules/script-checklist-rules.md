# Script Approval Checklist — Key Rules for Concept Creation

> Source: `strategy/BCH-content-playbook.md` (v2.0, 2026-02-24)
> This file captures operational rules from the 24-point Script Approval Checklist that affect how I write concepts.

---

## Team Workflow

- **Keshav** = primary script writer. Uses checklist for self-approval on daily content.
- **Ibrahim** only approves: big campaigns, new channel first 3 posts, competitor claims, unconfirmed pricing, brand/personality videos.
- If script passes 24/24, it's approved by the system — no need to wait for Ibrahim.

## Content Buckets (determines which checks apply)

| Bucket | Structure | CTA |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Sales** | 5-Beat: Hook → Relevance (3-8s) → Value (8-18s) → Trust (18-25s) → CTA | Video-specific + Brand signature — both mandatory |
| **Brand** | Hook + story, no 5-beat required | Brand signature CTA mandatory, video CTA optional |
| **Community** | Engagement-first (likes/comments/shares) | Brand signature CTA still required |

---

## Brand Signature CTA — MANDATORY ON EVERY VIDEO

**"Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni"** (or channel-specific catchphrase)
- Same words, same energy, same placement — EVERY video
- This is BCH LAW #21

### 2-Layer CTA System
1. **Video-specific CTA** (~3s): Clear action + channel phone number ("Call [number]" / "DM us" / "Visit BCH Yelahanka")
2. **Brand signature CTA** (~2s): "Cycle karidre, BCH ge banni"
- Total CTA time: MAX 5 seconds

## 3-Layer Hook System for Instagram

Each layer uses DIFFERENT phrasing but same core idea + primary keyword:

1. **On-Screen Text Hook** — 5-8 words, readable on mute, Frame 1, within safe zones
2. **Spoken Hook** — bold opening line (0.5-1.5s), complements but doesn't duplicate text
3. **Caption First Line** — first 125 characters, third phrasing, keyword in first line

**Golden Rule:** Complement, don't duplicate. Three phrasings of one idea.

## On-Screen Text Safe Zones
- Top: 108px margin
- Bottom: 320px margin
- Sides: 60px margin

## 5-Beat Sales Structure

| Beat | Timing | What |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 — Hook | 0-3s | Pattern interrupt (visual + verbal + audio) |
| 2 — Relevance | 3-8s | Viewer sees THEMSELVES ("school commute / office ride / birthday gift") |
| 3 — Value | 8-18s | New info every 3-5s: price, comparison, free stuff. Min 3 value drops. |
| 4 — Trust | 18-25s | Customer count, years, testimonial, store footage |
| 5 — CTA | Last 5s | Video CTA (3s) + Brand signature (2s) |

---

## Retention Hook at Midpoint

At ~50% of the video, insert a pattern interrupt or new text overlay to prevent mid-video dropoff:
- New visual, question, surprising stat, text change — anything that re-engages

---

## Instagram Keyword/SEO Rules

- **Primary keyword must be spoken clearly** at least once in the body — Instagram's audio transcription indexes this
- Primary keyword must appear in: on-screen text hook, spoken hook, caption first line, edit direction template
- Think of the keyword as the search term: "999 EMI cycle", "kids cycle Yelahanka", "e-cycle Bangalore"

## Edit Direction Template (5 lines — include with every script)

```
1. ON-SCREEN HOOK TEXT: "[Exact 5-8 word text]"
2. MUSIC/AUDIO: "[Mood — upbeat Kannada, suspense, silence start, SFX]"
3. TEXT OVERLAY STYLE: "[Product Spotlight / Customer Moment / Comparison / Calculator]"
4. KEYWORD: "[Primary keyword for SEO — e.g., 999 EMI electric cycle Bangalore]"
5. SPECIAL NOTES: "[Split screen, slow-mo, timelapse, etc.]"
```

## Scoring System

| Score | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 24/24 | Proceed to shoot |
| 20-23 | Fix gaps, then shoot |
| 16-19 | Rewrite failing sections |
| Below 16 | Start over |

Sales = scored out of 24. Brand = out of 18 (skip body checks). Community = out of 14 (skip body + CTA, but brand signature still required).

---

## Kannada-First Rule

Hook must be in Kannada. Always outperforms. Exception: national audience content only.
