## HOOK RULES

1. **Visual hook is non-negotiable.** Physical, dramatic action in first 1-3 sec. Without it = rejected regardless of story quality.
2. **Visual hook must be exaggerated.** Not basic. First frame must stop the scroll.
3. **Design ALL 4 hook layers:** Visual + Spoken + On-screen text + SFX. Not just visual.
4. **The concept IS the hook.** Don't bolt on separate hooks. The IDEA itself must stop the scroll. One sentence = you laugh.
5. **Hook score must be 8+/10.** Score every hook. Below 8 = reject and redo.
6. **Hook must open a MENTAL LOOP** — viewer thinks "what is happening?" and can ONLY get closure by watching till the end.
7. **Hook must work for non-followers.** Algorithm shows to followers first, then strangers. Hook must stop a RANDOM person.

## TG & CONVERSION RULES

8. **Hooks must be TG-SPECIFIC, not generic.** Design from target audience's DAILY LIFE EXPERIENCE. Chain snap = targets cyclists. Random accident = targets nobody.
9. **Tata Ace Test:** If this goes viral with 3M views, will those viewers actually BUY? Strong hook + wrong audience = wasted content.
10. **TG Life-Event Hook Method:** Pick a REAL daily-life moment they've lived through → exaggerate → connect to product naturally. Must not feel cringe.
11. **Show TG daily life moments but EXAGGERATED.** Externalize what they THINK but can't act on because of society.
12. **Premise must be BUYER-CENTRIC.** Viewer doesn't care about the owner. They care about THEIR problem at THEIR price.
13. **Content must have a CONVERSION PATH.** Hook → Value → Price → CTA. Not just Hook → Entertainment → Brand logo.

## CONTENT STRUCTURE RULES

14. **Every concept has 3 explicit sections:** (1) Pattern Interruption Visual Hook (0-3 sec), (2) Body — seamless from hook, (3) CTA — natural from body.
15. **Hook → Body must be SEAMLESS.** One piece, not two separate things.
16. **Body: value every 3-5 seconds.** Not repeated value — NEW value each time. Information, use cases, prices, comparisons.
17. **Body must include: "PROMOTING: [what exactly we're selling]."** If you can't name it, no conversion path.
18. **CTA must be CONSISTENT across a series.** Same CTA on all reels = cumulative urgency.
19. **Entertainment first, product second.** Entertain and induce product SILENTLY — strong on subconscious.

## SHARE & MEMORY RULES

20. **Every concept needs a share/comment trigger.** No built-in share reason = concept fails.
21. **Share/save triggers designed INTO the script** at specific moments. "Send this to [specific person]."
22. **Content must be MEMORABLE.** If describing it a week later doesn't make them remember, it fails.

## STYLE RULES

23. **Genre mismatch = the formula.** Everyday situation + absurd dramatic genre = comedy. Crime/legal/medical + mundane family life = highest hit rate.
24. **Simple + clever > complex + impressive.** Everyday objects in unexpected ways. Avoid specialty items.
25. **Concepts must be tight, shoot-ready, casual language.** Like the funeral benchmark.
26. **No generic themes.** Every concept needs a never-done-before visual metaphor.
27. **Avoid repeated content themes.** If chai math is done 5x, find a FRESH expense.
28. **Zero brand stats in concepts.** No "25 years," no hook scores, no formula labels in the actual content.
29. **Content must feel ORGANIC.** Shot and posted. No "produced ad" energy.
30. **Include ALL important details.** If concept says "23 checkpoints," script must list all 23.

## PRODUCTION RULES

31. **Locations = BCH store interior + entrance + footpath/street.** No external locations.
32. **Talent = BCH staff + customers + Reddy kid.** Crew: Anil + 1 assistant.
33. **Props under Rs. 1000-2000 budget.** Use what's available creatively.
34. **CTA Formula:** Signature phrase + Behavioral trigger + BCH Jayanagar + Deadline + DM keyword.

## WHAT GETS APPROVED (pattern)
- ONE absurd image, funny in a single sentence
- Crime/investigation + innocent activity
- Physical escalation or comedic TURN
- Body carries concept — dialogue supports, never leads
- Kids doing adult-serious-genre things
- Dark, suspicious energy >>> wholesome, celebratory

## WHAT GETS REJECTED (pattern)
- No physical visual hook
- External locations / home setups needed
- Sentimental / celebratory / cute
- Phone screens or text chats as hooks
- Gimmick-driven with nothing underneath
- Dialogue/narration-heavy (body must tell story, not mouth)
- Structured formats (auditions, reality shows, talent competitions)
- Interview/talking style (every brand does this)
- Repeated themes disguised as new concepts

## BENCHMARK
**SB7 (Trade-In Funeral) = perfect reel.** Garland on rusty cycle + incense = 9/10 hook. Absurd visual → emotional beat → conversion CTA. This is the standard.
